I am here to act as your thought partner and consultant, helping you quickly analyze complex information from the provided sources to develop strategic recommendations [i]. The knowledge base consists of policy documents and rejection case files from various lenders, including Aditya Birla Finance Limited (ABFL), Bajaj Finserv, Clix Capital, Credit Saison, HDFC, Hero Fincorp, IDFC, IIFL, InCred, Induslnd Bank, Leading Kart, MAS Financial Services, Muthoot, Neo Growth, Poonawalla Fincorp, Piramal, Protium, SCB, Shriram Finance, Deutsche Bank, Godrej Capital, Krazybee, UGro Capital, Utkarsh Small Finance Bank, and Cholamandalam (Chola).

Here is an analysis of the mandatory eligibility criteria and banking surrogate norms based on the provided documents:

---

## Prompt 1: Basic Eligibility Criteria

### 1. Minimum Annual Turnover

Minimum annual turnover requirements vary significantly depending on the lender, the product type, and whether the account is internal or external:

| Lender/Program | Minimum Turnover Requirement | Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **HDFC** | Min 80 lakhs (internal account) or 1 crore (external account). | |
| **Shriram Finance** | 3 Cr to 300 Cr (for Banking/GST Surrogate). | |
| **Credit Saison** | Min 2 Cr (DSCR/GST programs) or Min 1 Cr (Banking Program). | |
| **Clix Capital** | Min 1 crore (Banking/GST/Income up to 35L). Min 2 crore (Income >35L). | |
| **Protium (Banking)** | Min average turnover of 2 lakhs per month (implied 24 lakhs annually). | |
| **Leading Kart** | Annual Business Revenue > 3,00,000. | |
| **Induslnd Bank** | Min 1 Cr (Income/GST) or 50 lakhs (Banking). | |
| **SCB (BIL program)** | Minimum 10 Cr (Services), 20 Cr (Manufacturing), or 25 Cr (Trading). | |
| **Godrej Capital (LTS)** | 1cr to 3cr (Top 7/Tier 1) or 50L to 1cr (Tier 2). | |

*Note on Audited vs. Unaudited:* While some programs require financials, the sources often cite turnover derived from GST returns or banking transaction reports (BTO), which may not strictly require fully audited financials unless specified, such as in the Income/DSCR programs.

### 2. Minimum Business Vintage (Years in operation)

The most frequently cited minimum business vintage requirement is 3 years.

| Lender/Program | Minimum Vintage | Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Clix, Credit Saison, Hero Fincorp, IIFL, Induslnd, Poonawalla (most products), Piramal, HDFC, Shriram** | 3 years. | |
| **Protium / Leading Kart** | Min 12 months. | |
| **Godrej Capital** | 2 years (for max loan 7L in LTS). Min 7 years for HT programs. | |
| **Neo Growth (Insta Retail)** | 2 years. | |
| **InCred (Self Employed)** | More than 24 Months (2 years). | |

### 3. Minimum CIBIL Score for the Proprietor/Director

The preferred minimum CIBIL score for most lenders is 700 or above.

| CIBIL Score | Lenders/Norms | Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **750** | SMFG. | |
| **700+** | Clix, Hero Fincorp, IIFL, Neo Growth (most programs), Poonawalla (key applicant), Godrej Capital (all programs). | |
| **680** | Induslnd Bank. Shriram Finance (up to 35L). Poonawalla (co-applicant). Neo Growth (Retail Financial). | |
| **650** | Credit Saison. InCred. Leading Kart. Protium. MAS Financial Services. | |

### 4. Is GST Registration mandatory?

GST registration is mandatory for most surrogate programs, especially for loan amounts above a certain threshold or for higher-risk B2B segments.

*   **Mandatory for most programs:** HDFC requires GST and GST returns. Poonawalla's GST Program requires Gst Karza. Clix's GST Margin Program requires 12 months' GST returns.
*   **Thresholds:** Shriram finance requires GST return mandatory above 20 lakh loan amount. Protium requires GSTR3B for the last 12 months for loan amounts greater than 15L.
*   **Exceptions/Alternatives:** Poonawalla offers a Non-GST Program (Max loan Upto 15 Lakhs). Neo Growth's Insta Retail product does not require GST Registration.
*   **Age of Registration:** Bajaj Finserv explicitly considers a vintage of 2 years in GST for a maximum loan amount of 8 Lakhs.

---

## Prompt 2: Banking Analysis (ABB)

The Banking Surrogate method relies heavily on Average Bank Balance (ABB) or Banking Turnover (BTO) to estimate income and repayment capacity.

### 1. What is the minimum Average Bank Balance (ABB) required?

The minimum ABB required typically ranges from INR 5,000 to INR 1,00,000 per month, often based on the duration (3, 6, or 12 months).

*   **Lowest:** Leading Kart requires a 90 days Adjusted weighted Average Daily Balance (ADB) of > 5,000.
*   **Mid-Range:** Protium requires a Min ABB of 10,000. Neo Growth Insta requires ABB >10K. Godrej Capital (Income Method) requires Min ABB of 50k for last 6 months.
*   **Highest/Common:** Credit Saison requires 12 months ABB to be 1 lakh and above. Induslnd Bank requires the last 6 months ABB to be 1 lakh and above. Godrej Capital (Banking Surrogate/Women Entrepreneur) requires Min ABB of 1 Lakh for 6 months.

### 2. How do you calculate eligibility based on ABB?

Eligibility in Banking Surrogate programs is often calculated using a multiplier applied to the ABB, or a ratio comparing the ABB to the proposed EMI.

*   **ABB to EMI Ratio:**
    *   Godrej Capital (LTS Program): ABB:EMI is 2 times.
    *   Godrej Capital (HT Program): ABB:EMI is 4:1.
    *   Clix Capital (Banking Surrogate): ABB to EMI ratio of 2:1.
    *   Piramal (Cash Profit Norms): ABB:EMI is 1.
*   **Multiplier Based on ABB:**
    *   Aditya Birla Finance Limited (ABFL) (Average Banking Program): Loan amount calculation uses an ABB to EMI multiplier that varies between 2, 3, or 4, depending on the loan amount.
    *   Leading Kart (Banking Surrogate): Loan assignment uses a multiplier assigned on ADB (Average Daily Balance) and Revenue, with a maximum ADB multiplier of 17.
*   **Loan Amount from Banking/Credit:**
    *   Protium shows a case where an eligible loan amount of 7 Lakhs was calculated based on an Average Bank Balance (ABB) of 12 Lakhs.
    *   The BIL Express program by ABFL requires minimum L6M banking credit > 75 Lacs.

### 3. What are the rules for 'Banking Churn' or 'Inward Cheque Returns'?

Lenders impose strict controls on negative banking behavior such as cheque bounces or ECS/NACH returns due to insufficient funds.

*   **ECS/NACH Bounces:** Protium enforces "No ECS bounces in last 90 days". MAS Financial Services strictly prohibits NACH/ECS bounces due to genuine insufficient fund in the last 3 months, allowing only 1 such bounce in the last 6 months if the EMI is paid within that particular month.
*   **EMI/Cheque Returns (Count/Percentage):**
    *   Leading Kart rejects applications if EMI Returns are >2 in the Last 3 Months. They also reject if Inward Cheque returns due to ‘insufficient funds’ (ChqRtnIwdIF) are 2.5% or more of the total Transaction, or if 3 months IWFI cheque returns >= 9.
    *   MAS Financial Services limits inward cheque returns during the last 6 months to not more than 3, or 5% (in BS product) / 3% (in other products) of total cheques issued, whichever is higher. For the last 12 months, the limit is not more than 6 returns or 5% of total cheques issued.
    *   Neo Growth requires cheque bounce <1%.
    *   Protium maintains a hard filter of "No 01+ in last 6 months".

---

**Next Step Suggestion:** Given the variability in turnover requirements and the strictness of the CIBIL score requirements across different lenders, especially between core surrogate products (700+ CIBIL, high turnover) and micro/lite products (650 CIBIL, lower turnover), we should now analyze the **Specific Industry Margins (GST/Gross Profit)** used by lenders like Aditya Birla, Credit Saison, Induslnd, and MAS Financial Services to understand which sectors offer the best eligibility under GST/Margin programs and identify potential arbitrage opportunities in sector targeting.






This analysis focuses on how loan eligibility is determined through turnover and margin metrics, and outlines specific industry rules and exclusions.

---

## Prompt 3: Turnover Multipliers

Loan eligibility based on turnover is rarely calculated using a simple percentage of annual turnover for the final loan amount. Instead, turnover is converted into imputed income via industry margins, and then the loan amount is derived from the resulting EMI capacity (DSCR/FOIR).

### 1. What percentage of the Annual Turnover is given as a loan?

There is no fixed percentage across all lenders; the loan amount is typically a capped value based on defined turnover brackets, or determined by the borrower's capacity (DSCR) derived from the imputed income.

*   **Fixed Caps within Turnover Ranges (IIFL):** IIFL provides maximum loan amounts based on turnover brackets:
    *   Turnover between 1 Cr and 2 Cr: Max loan amount is 12 Lakhs (Trader) or 15 Lakhs (Manufacturer/Services).
    *   Turnover between 5 Cr and 7.5 Cr: Max loan amount is 25 Lakhs (Trader) or 35 Lakhs (Services).
*   **High Turnover Requirements (SCB BIL Program):** The SCB BIL program offers a maximum loan amount of 1.25 Cr but requires minimum annual turnover as high as 10 Cr (Services), 20 Cr (Manufacturing), or 25 Cr (Trading).
*   **Banking Turnover to GST Turnover Ratio:** Cholamandalam (Chola) requires Banking Turnover (BTO) to be 80% of the GST Turnover. Clix Capital also requires BTO to be 80% of the GST turnover (last 12 months) for their GST Margin Program. MAS Financial Services requires banking to be a minimum of 70% of the revenue as per the last 12 months GST returns.
*   **Minimum Turnover:** Clix Capital's Banking Surrogate program requires a minimum turnover of 1 crore. HDFC requires a minimum turnover of 80 lakhs (internal account) or 1 crore (external account).

### 2. Does this percentage change for Manufacturers vs. Traders vs. Service Providers?

Yes, the *implied* loan percentage (due to income calculation) and the maximum loan caps change, reflecting different risk profiles and underlying industry margins:

*   **IIFL Maximum Loan Caps:** For customers with 5 Cr to 7.5 Cr turnover, the max loan cap is 25 Lakhs for Traders, 30 Lakhs for Manufacturers, and 35 Lakhs for Service providers, indicating higher eligibility for Services.
*   **Godrej Capital HT Program Minimum Turnover:** For loan amounts greater than 35L, the minimum annualized turnover is 25 Cr for Manufacturer/Services profiles, but 35 Cr for Traders.
*   **Deutsche Bank GST Program Minimum Turnover:** Requires 5 Cr for Manufacturing and Services, but 10 Cr for Trading.

### 3. How is the 'Net Profit Margin' factored in?

Eligibility is primarily derived from **Gross Margin** or **Cash Profit** (a proxy for net profit after adjustments), which is applied to the turnover to estimate Eligible Income:

*   **Aditya Birla Finance Limited (ABFL):** Eligible Income is calculated as Turnover multiplied by the Margin defined for the relevant industry as per policy. Gross Profit is applicable for Traders and Manufacturers only. DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio) is checked on Eligible Income, requiring it to be greater than 1.
*   **Piramal Cash Profit Norms:** Business Income calculation starts with Profit After Tax (PAT) and adds back Depreciation, Salary/Interest paid to Partners/Directors, and certain interest payments, yielding a cash profit figure used for underwriting. The business must be cash profitable in the last three years (for MAS Financial Services) or PBT positive (Piramal).
*   **Deutsche Bank Margin Calculation:** The loan eligible amount is calculated by taking the GST Turnover, multiplying it by the Gross Profit (G.P) or Industry Margin, and dividing the result by 3666 (to get the monthly equivalent capacity) after factoring in obligation.

---

## Prompt 4: Industry Margins & Negative Lists

Lenders maintain specific policy rules for different sectors, including applying distinct income margins and maintaining extensive negative lists.

### 1. List of 'Negative Industries' (e.g., Jewelers, Real Estate, Gyms)

Numerous industries are explicitly restricted or marked as high-risk by lenders:

| Industry/Category | Specific Examples (Lenders) | Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Financial Services/Lending** | Money lenders, pawn brokers, private financers, Chit fund operators, Nidhi company, NBFCs, stock broking/security trading, DSA/Collection agencies. | |
| **High Value/Speculative Trade** | Real Jewellery/diamond/bullion manufacturing and trading, Shares/bitcoins/old coins trading or other speculative activities. | |
| **Real Estate/Construction** | Builders, Real Estate Agents, Building contractors. Construction Contractors (InCred). | |
| **Alcohol/Tobacco/Gambling** | Bar/Permit Room/Liquor shop owners, Wine Shops, Liquor Shops, Tobacco products, Gambling, Casinos, Lottery Business. | |
| **Professional Services** | Advocates, Judges, lawyers (except Solicitor Firms/High/Supreme Court), Insurance agents, Astrologer, Non-qualified medical practitioners. LIC Insurance agents rejected by Poonawalla and Aditya Birla for lack of ITR/Form 16. | |
| **Other High-Risk Services** | Security Service Providers, Private Security, Collection/Recovery agencies, Gym Owners, Massage Parlours, Salon and Spa, Film production/Financier. | |

### 2. List of 'High Risk' industries that require higher interest rates.

While the documents list restricted/negative industries, they do not explicitly provide a separate list of industries that require *higher interest rates* (ROI). The ROI ranges provided (e.g., Protium: 18%–34%; Piramal: 16.99% to 20.99%) indicate that pricing is risk-based, but the specific industries linked to the higher end of the range are not delineated, though negative profiles are automatically rejected.

### 3. Are there specific margin assumptions for different sectors?

Yes, several lenders specify distinct industry margins used in their GST or Margin programs to impute income/cash profit from turnover:

| Lender | Program | Service (%) | Manufacturer/MFG (%) | Trader (%) | Wholesale Trader (%) | Retail Trader (%) | Other (%) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Credit Saison** | GST Program | 12% | 8% | 5% | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| **MAS Financial** | GST Margin | 12% | 8% | N/A | 5% | 7.50% | Petrol Pump/Gas Agency: 2% |
| **Induslnd Bank** | GST Program | 10% | 8% | 9% | 4% | N/A | N/A |
| **Deutsche Bank**| Margin Method | 2% | 2.5% | 2% | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| **Krazybee** | Banking/GST | N/A | N/A | N/A | 5% | N/A | Petrol & Diesel: 3% |

---

**Next Step Suggestion:** The core of eligibility calculation relies on the interplay between eligible income derived from these margins and existing debt obligations. We should now analyze the specific **DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio) and FOIR (Fixed Obligation to Income Ratio) norms** for various lenders, particularly focusing on the target thresholds (e.g., Min DSCR of 1.0, Max FOIR of 70%) to understand the maximum leverage allowed once the income is imputed.

## Prompt 5: Ownership & Constitution

### 1. Are there different rules for Proprietorship vs. Partnership vs. Pvt Ltd?

Yes, the rules and requirements differ across business constitutions, primarily like InCred, which allows only proprietorship profiles for Self Employed Non-Professionals BL. Generally subject to the same minimum vintage and turnover as other entities (e.g., 3 years vintage at HDFC [2 lenders like Leading Kart, Clix, and Protium. Requires all partners/directors to be considered as co-borrowers for the loan (Leading Kart).DFC mandates that the maximum shareholder must be a co-applicant. InCred generally restricts Pvt Ltd companies with more than one owner for their Self Employed Non-Professional product. | |
| **Sole Proprietorship vs. Pvt Ltd (HDFC)** | HDFC policy outlines similar minimum turnover (80 lakhs internal/1 Cr external) and vintage (Min 3 years) for both Sole Prop & Partnership and Pvt Ltd, but requires MOA/AOA/List of Directors for Pvt Ltd. | |

### 2. For Partnerships, do all partners need to sign?

Generally, partners or directors holding a controlling interest must be applicants or co-applicants:

*   **Leading Kart:** For Partnership firms and Private Limited companies, **all partners/directors will be considered as co-borrowers** for the loan.
*   **Protium:** For Partnership firms and Limited Liability Partnerships, the firm is the main applicant, and **Partners holding $\ge 51\%$ of the capital of the firm must be co-applicants** to the case.
*   **HDFC:** For Pvt Ltd, the **Maximum shareholder should be co applicant**.
*   **MAS Financial Services:** Requires **All concern persons + One female co-applicant** (though the context is not limited strictly to partnership, it refers to all concerned persons).

### 3. For Pvt Ltd, is the Board Resolution mandatory?

While the term "Board Resolution" is not explicitly listed, the documentation requirements for Private Limited Companies imply comprehensive corporate documents are needed, which typically include the MOA (Memorandum of Association) and AOA (Articles of Association), and a List of Directors, as mandated by HDFC. The execution of the loan generally requires specific authorization (often a Board Resolution), though the exact document name is not listed as a mandatory login requirement in the source excerpts.

---

## Prompt 6: Documentation Requirements

The documents required depend on the program (Surrogate vs. Income/ITR) but generally include KYC, business proof, banking statements, and GST returns.

### 1. KYC of Firm and Proprietor

*   **Individual KYC:** Aadhaar, Pan Card, Passport size photo.
*   **Entity KYC:** GST Certificate, Udyam Certificate.
    *   *Note:* The Udyam Certificate is specifically required for the ABFL BIL Express program,. Krazybee notes Udhayam is **not** considered for Address/Biz registration proof.
*   **HDFC (Pvt Ltd Specific):** MOA, AOA, and List of Directors are required.

### 2. Financials (ITR for how many years? Audited Balance Sheet?)

The number of years of financial documents (ITR/Balance Sheet) required depends heavily on the maximum loan amount sought and the program type:

*   **ITR Program (Income/DSCR):**
    *   HDFC requires **Latest 2 years ITR full set**. If Tax audit is applicable, Form 3cb and Form 3cd are needed.
    *   Piramal requires **Latest year full set of financials and ITR** with Audit Report where applicable, and the Cash Profit Norms program requires **2 years of full set of financials and ITR** with Audit Report where applicable.
    *   InCred offers ITR as a business proof (Last two years with COI, minimum gap of 6 months).
    *   SMFG Verified Income Program requires **Last 2 years audited financials**.
*   **Surrogate Programs (Banking/GST):** ITR is often not required (Hero Fincorp up to 35L) or is not the primary basis for eligibility. U Gro Capital specifically highlights "NO ITR Required".

### 3. Bank Statements (6 months or 12 months?)

12 months of banking statements are commonly required, especially for surrogate programs, but 6 months is also frequently cited.

*   **12 Months Banking:** Required by Protium (along with current month banking if past the 9th), HDFC (Current account statement 1yr), SCB, Hero Fincorp, and U Gro Capital (PDF Banking latest One year).
*   **6 Months Banking:** Required by Clix Capital (6 months bank statements of all operative accounts), HDFC (GSTR 3b latest 6m is cited alongside 1yr statement), Piramal, Godrej Capital (Last 6 months banking), and InCred.

### 4. GST Returns (GSTR-3B for how many months?)

GST returns, specifically GSTR 3B, are mandatory for most surrogate programs.

*   **12 Months GST Returns:** Required by Clix Capital, ABFL (latest 12 months for GST Program), and Deutsche Bank (Last 1 year GSTR for GST Program).
*   **6 Months GST Returns:** HDFC requires GSTR 3b latest 6m.
*   **12 Months GSTR3B for High Value Loans:** Protium requires GSTR3B for the last 12 months for loan amounts greater than 15L.

---

**Next Step Suggestion:** We have established the income derivation (Turnover * Margin) and the required documentation. To finalize the picture of financial risk assessment, the crucial final step is to analyze the actual **Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) and Fixed Obligation to Income Ratio (FOIR) targets**. We should consolidate the minimum DSCR requirements (e.g., ABFL/Clix requiring >1, Credit Saison 0.75) and the maximum FOIR limits (e.g., IDFC/InCred 70%, Shriram 100%) to understand how lenders apply these ratios to the imputed income to determine the final loan amount.





This) and Top-Up based on the provided source materials.

---

## Prompt 7: Collateral & Security

### 1. Is this an Unsecured loan or are there collateral options?

The majority of the programs described are
Yes, there is a maximum cap on the loan amount for unsecured products, which varies by lender and program:

*   **Max 1 Crore:** Aditya Birla Finance Limited (ABFL) ITR Program,6, 127], Credit Saison ITR Program, Neo Growth Retail-Financial Program.
*   **Max 50 Lakhs:** Hero Fincorp [ Chola GST Max LA.
*   **Max 35 Lakhs:** Leading Kart.
*   **Max 25 Lakhs:** Protium, Godrej Capital (various programs like Banking Surrogate, GST Program).
*   **Max 8 Lakhs:** Bajaj Finserv, considering vintage of 2 years in GST.

### 2. Is CGTMSE coverage available?

The provided sources **do not mention** CGTMSE (Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises) coverage [i].

### 3. Do we need Post Dated Cheques (PDC) or NACH mandate?

While the specific requirement for "PDC" is not detailed, the need for regular electronic repayment authorization is strongly implied through the strict rules regarding ECS/NACH bounces, indicating that mandates are utilized:

*   **NACH/ECS Bounce Rules:** MAS Financial Services strictly states that **No NACH/ECS bounces** due to genuine insufficient funds are allowed in the last 3 months. Only 1 such bounce is allowed in the last 6 months, provided the EMI is paid within that particular month.
*   **Cheque Bounce Rules:** Protium enforces "No ECS bounces in last 90 days". Leading Kart rejects if EMI Returns (which includes NACH/ECS) are >2 in the Last 3 Months.

---

## Prompt 8: Top-Up & Balance Transfer

### 1. What are the rules for Balance Transfer (BT) of a Business Loan?

Balance Transfer (BT) is allowed by multiple lenders, often with conditions on loan performance:

*   **Muthoot Policy:** Allows **Unlimited BT**.
*   **IDFC Policy (Personal Loan/BT context):** While focused on PL, it sets precedent for BT eligibility, requiring more than 6 months EMI completion mandatory for a loan to be eligible for BT. However, it allows BT after just 1 month EMI completion for specific banks (AXIS BANK, ICICI BANK, BAJAJ FLEXI OD, HDFC & HDFC jumbo).
*   **IIFL Policy:** Allows Top-up only after completing **12 EMI** (subject to nil bounce).

### 2. Can we Top-Up over the BT amount?

Yes, Top-Up is a defined product offered by several lenders, sometimes combined with a BT:

*   **ABFL Existing Borrower Top-Up:** Offers multipliers of 1.2x or 1.3x of the Existing EMI, depending on the business vintage (9-18 MOB vs. >18 MOB). Only **one top up is allowed** under this program.
*   **Poonawalla Fincorp:** Allows Balance Transfer (implied by unlimited BT allowance). The products allow for high number of live loans (e.g., 8 live BL loans allowed for Banking Surrogate, 14 live loans allowed for GST Program), suggesting new loan origination or consolidation/top-up is common.

### 3. Do we need a foreclosure letter from the previous lender?

The sources **do not explicitly state** that a foreclosure letter is required at the login stage. However, the requirement for a clear loan closure/foreclosure process is implied for a Balance Transfer, as the new lender would need documentation to repay and close the previous loan. The prompt notes mention that EMI of loans getting closed in the next 6 months are not obligated (Piramal), which suggests the status of prior obligations is managed, but the specific foreclosure letter requirement is not listed among the mandatory login documents.

---

**Next Step Suggestion:** We have reviewed security, caps, and BT/Top-Up rules. The final critical analysis area is the application of leverage constraints. We should now proceed with the planned analysis of **DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio) and FOIR (Fixed Obligation to Income Ratio) targets**, focusing on how these ratios are used to convert the imputed income (Turnover * Margin) into the final eligible EMI/Loan amount for lenders like Clix Capital, Credit Saison, Induslnd Bank, and Shriram Finance.







This analysis provides the standard fees and charges, followed by a concise summary of the key mathematical and structural eligibility rules across the provided documents.

---

## Prompt 9: Fees & Charges

### 1. Processing Fee percentage (PF)

The standard processing fee (PF) for unsecured business loans typically ranges from 2% to 6% of the loan amount:

*   **2% PF:** Cited by Credit Saison, Induslnd Bank, and Shriram Finance.
*   **3% - 6% PF:** Cited by Protium.

### 2. Insurance Requirements

Credit Life Insurance is frequently a mandatory or applicable requirement for these loans:

*   **Compulsory/Applicable:** Insurance is applicable for Credit Saison and Induslnd Bank. MAS Financial Services requires Credit Life Insurance as compulsory.
*   **Minimum Percentage:** Hero Fincorp specifies a minimum insurance charge of 1%.
*   **Included in Loan Cap:** Piramal’s maximum loan amount of INR 30 Lakhs is often stated as "Max Loan:- INR 30 Lakhs + Insurance".

*(Note: The documents do not specify requirements for Keyman Insurance, which is typically relevant for higher-value, income-based corporate loans.)*

### 3. Foreclosure Charges

The provided source materials **do not explicitly list the percentage or calculation method for foreclosure or prepayment charges** [i].

*However, related policies indicate that managing existing obligations is key:* Piramal notes that EMI of loans getting closed in the next 6 months are not obligated. IIFL allows top-up only after completing 12 EMIs.

---

## Prompt 10: FINAL CONFIGURATION SUMMARY

The exact configuration varies significantly by program (ITR vs. GST vs. Banking) and lender risk appetite (LTS vs. HT). Below is a summary of the most common or highest observed thresholds for an Unsecured Business Loan, focusing on the configuration used to determine *maximum* eligibility:

| Parameter | Recommended Value/Range (Prime Unsecured Program) | Supporting Rationale/Sources |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Min Annual Turnover** | **1 Crore** | This is the minimum required for standard GST/Income programs at Clix, IIFL, Induslnd, and HDFC (external account). |
| **Min Business Vintage** | **3 Years** | Mandated by most major lenders including Clix, HDFC, Hero Fincorp, IIFL, Induslnd, and Poonawalla. |
| **Min CIBIL Score** | **700** | Required for the key applicant in most standard unsecured products (Clix, Hero Fincorp, Poonawalla, Godrej). |
| **Turnover Multiplier (Margin)** | **5% (Trader) to 12% (Service)** | Eligibility is not a direct loan multiplier but calculated as: **Income = Turnover x Margin**. Margins used are 5% for Traders (Credit Saison, MAS Wholesale), 8% for Manufacturers (Credit Saison, MAS), and 12% for Services (Credit Saison, MAS). |
| **ABB Multiplier (Capacity)** | **2:1 (ABB:EMI)** | This is the common calculation for Banking Surrogate programs (Clix, Godrej LTS). This means the eligible monthly EMI should not exceed 50% of the Average Bank Balance (ABB). |
| **Max Loan Amount (Unsecured)** | **1 Crore** | This is the highest limit offered through Income/ITR programs by ABFL, Poonawalla Fincorp, and Deutsche Bank (non-OD customer). |

---

**Next Step Suggestion:** We have reviewed the configuration inputs (Turnover, Margin, ABB) and constraints (CIBIL, Vintage). To fully define the underwriting logic and provide actionable strategic recommendations on target borrower capacity, the next logical step is to analyze how the estimated income is constrained by **DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio) and FOIR (Fixed Obligation to Income Ratio)**. Specifically, we should analyze the differences between lenders like Clix (Min DSCR 0.85 to 1.0) and Credit Saison (Min DSCR 0.75) to understand where eligibility is maximized based on existing obligations.
