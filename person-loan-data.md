### Key Concepts and Insights from the Comparison

1.  **Minimum Salary Flexibility:** Minimum salary requirements vary significantly, reflecting geographical differences and targeted customer segments. **WeRize** and **MAS Finance** accept the lowest salaries (₹12,000 and ₹18,000 respectively), potentially broadening their market reach. In contrast, Bajaj Finserv requires **₹50,000** in prime locations, and Poonawala requires **₹30,000** across India.
2.  **CIBIL Score Tolerance:** Several lenders explicitly allow applicants with **No Credit History (CIBIL 0 or -1)**, though often with capping on the maximum loan amount. For instance, **Muthoot** allows -1 CIBIL for a maximum loan of ₹1.5L. Bajaj Finserv allows 0/-1 in their Bureau No-Hit Program. Conversely, InCred generally states that NTC is "not allowed" for self-employed individuals.
3.  **Maximum Financial Obligation (FOIR):** The FOIR is a critical determinant of eligibility, and the maximum limit generally caps out at **75%** for premium profiles at lenders like Aditya Birla and Piramal Finance. **Tata Capital** also sets its maximum FOIR at 75%, marketing it as "Best in PL Industry". The lowest FOIR ceiling found is **30%** for the lowest income band (18K-25K) at MAS Finance.
4.  **Loan Multipliers:** Multipliers determine the maximum loan amount relative to salary (Loan Amount = NTH * Multiplier). **Axis Finance** offers multipliers up to **30 times**, and **Chola** and **Kotak Mahindra Bank** both mention up to **32 times** for their highest segments/shortest tenures. In contrast, **Piramal Finance** explicitly states **"No Multiplier Calculation"** is used.
5.  **Interest Rate Competitiveness:** The lowest stated interest rates are generally clustered among the larger banks and NBFCs targeting specific premium or employee segments. **ICICI** offers a flat rate as low as **10.55%** for the ICICI Group/Infosys Group, while **Bandhan Bank** lists rates starting at **10.50%**, and **Kotak Mahindra Bank** offers a promotional rate of **10.99%** for higher loan amounts. New-age lenders like Finnable list a significantly higher starting rate of **19.99%**, and MAS Finance starts at **18%**.

This comparison illustrates that while larger banks (ICICI, Kotak) may offer lower interest rates and targeted programs for high-CIBIL/high-income clients, NBFCs (like Finnable, Werize, MAS Finance) tend to be more flexible regarding minimum salary and credit history, albeit sometimes with higher interest rates or stricter FOIR checks for certain segments.

### Clarification Analogy

Think of these policies as admissions criteria for an exclusive club:

*   **Salary Classification** is like the **Membership Tier**. A high-tier member (e.g., Bajaj Finserv's Diamond/Platinum or Kotak's CAT AA) might get perks like a lower minimum salary in some circumstances or larger loans, but a general member (Unlisted) has to meet stricter rules or pay a higher fee (higher NTH or higher multiplier in Bajaj).
*   **CIBIL Requirements** are the **Security Clearance Level**. While a 730+ score gets you in the main entrance (Bandhan Bank), some clubs (Bajaj, Kotak) have a special side door for people with no history (CIBIL 0/-1) if they meet strict compensating factors (age limit, loan cap).
*   **Foreclosure Charges** are the **Exit Fee**. Some lenders (Piramal, Bandhan Bank above 10L) offer a free exit, while others (Poonawala) make you wait a fixed period (6 EMIs) before they waive the charge.








This analysis provides a detailed breakdown of the financial calculation methodologies employed by the lenders documented in the sources, focusing on FOIR limits, multiplier logic, and acceptance of non-direct salary modes.

### Detailed Analysis of Financial Calculation Logic

#### 1. FOIR Calculation and Salary Dependency

The Fixed Obligation to Income Ratio (FOIR) is the most critical metric across all lenders, determining the maximum debt an applicant can carry relative to their income.

*   **Maximum Limits (70% - 80%):** The highest maximum FOIR limits are reserved for the premium, high-income, and low-risk segments.
    *   **Poonawala (PFL)** offers the absolute highest stated FOIR of **80%** for Super HNI (Net Take Home > ₹2.5L) and Super A/Cat A categories within the very-low risk band.
    *   **Aditya Birla Capital Ltd (ABCL)**, **Piramal Finance**, and **Tata Capital (TCL)** cap their standard FOIR at **75%**. TCL markets this 75% as "Best in PL Industry".
    *   **Kotak Mahindra Bank** also allows **75%** FOIR for customers with live Home Loan tracks.

*   **FOIR Increase with Salary:** In almost all cases, the maximum allowable FOIR increases as the net monthly salary (NTH) increases, reflecting the assumption that high earners have greater discretionary income after meeting basic living expenses.
    *   **Bajaj Finserv** limits FOIR for salaried individuals earning < ₹50K to **60%**, but allows it to rise to **70%** for those earning > ₹1L.
    *   **IDFC First Bank** raises the limit from 50% (Cat C, D, Unlisted, < ₹40K salary) to **70%** (for all categories > ₹75K salary).
    *   **MAS Finance** provides a very strict, incremental scale, starting at **30%** (₹18K–₹25K) and only reaching **60%** (₹75K and above).
    *   **TCL** follows this pattern, moving from 60% (NTH < ₹50K) up to **75%** (NTH > ₹75K).

*   **Exceptions and Compensating Factors:** FOIR calculation is often influenced by housing status and existing relationships:
    *   **BFL** allows a higher FOIR (up to 70%) for customers with an existing Home Loan ("Ever HL in CIBIL Report") compared to those without (65% for the same income bracket).
    *   **ABCL** offers a 100% FOIR cap in their Paperless BT program, provided specific MOB (Months on Book) and track criteria are met.

#### 2. Multiplier Logic

Loan Multipliers (a ratio applied to Net Take Home/NTH) are used by many lenders, usually calculating the loan amount as: *Loan Amount = NTH \* Multiplier*. Some lenders use the multiplier on the *remaining* salary after deducting existing obligations.

*   **Kotak Mahindra Bank's Unique Calculation:** Kotak explicitly uses the formula: **(NTH – Obligation) \* Multiplier**, effectively reducing the loan size based on existing debt before the multiplier is applied. They offer the highest stated maximum multiplier of **32x**.
*   **Tata Capital's Approach:** TCL explicitly states that they take the multiplier on the **Net in hand Salary (NTH)** and **do not deduct existing obligation** from the salary before applying the multiplier. TCL's highest multiplier is **27x**.
*   **Bajaj Finserv's Segmentation:** BFL utilizes a highly complex multiplier grid based on risk segmentation and salary band, peaking at **24x** for the best profiles with a Home Loan track. The lowest general multiplier is 10x.
*   **Lenders Excluding Multipliers:** **Piramal Finance** explicitly states **"No Multiplier Calculation"**, relying solely on FOIR (up to 75%) and risk profile. **MAS Finance** also uses **"Only FOIR basis approval"**. **InCred**, for self-employed non-professionals, uses a **Max EMI Logic** based on Average Bank Balance (ABB) rather than a simple NTH multiplier.

#### 3. Cash/Cheque Salary Acceptance

Direct salary credit is overwhelmingly preferred, and several key lenders explicitly reject or impose strict conditions on non-direct modes like cash or cheque payments, or even IMPS transfers.

*   **Explicitly Disallowed (Bajaj Finserv):** BFL explicitly rejects non-direct modes: "Salary credits in bank statement should be only through direct mode and **not cash/cheque**".
*   **Strict Conditions (WeRize):** WeRize requires salary to be via **Bank transfer (NEFT/RTGS/IMPS)**. If the payment is via IMPS mode, the employer must be a **PVT LTD company** and **PF deduction should be there**. This implies that cash or cheque payments are not accepted.
*   **Implicitly Disallowed (Poonawala):** PFL explicitly states **"Cash Salary not allowed"** for Cat E employees. Salary must reflect as a credit in the bank statement.
*   **Focus on Documentation (ABCL, Piramal):** Some policies emphasize confirming income via external proofs if salary slips are missing, such as Form 16, IT Returns, or PF/OMC confirmation. While this might allow documentation for an unusual payment structure, they still rely on verifiable bank credits or official tax documents, rather than raw cash deposits.

***
**Analogy:** The interplay between FOIR and the Multiplier is like planning a long road trip with a budget.

**FOIR (Fixed Obligation to Income Ratio)** is your **Fuel Gauge**. It measures how much of your monthly income is already spent on fixed costs (EMIs, rent). Even if you have a massive engine (high multiplier), if your fuel gauge is already showing 90% usage (high FOIR), the bank won't let you start a new journey, fearing you'll run out of gas mid-way.

The **Multiplier** is the **Size of your Gas Tank**. If your salary is high, the multiplier (e.g., 27x) allows you to draw a large loan (a huge tank). However, Kotak checks if your tank is already partially empty *before* calculating the size (NTH - Obligation \* Multiplier), while Tata Capital calculates the full tank size *first* (NTH \* Multiplier), and then uses the FOIR rule to check if the new EMI fits into your remaining safe spending capacity (remaining fuel).

### 3. Location Restrictions (Negative Pincodes/Areas)

Restrictions are placed both on physical residence/office proximity to branches and on specific geographic areas deemed high risk ("Negative Area").

| Lender | Location Restriction Type | Specific Locations/Conditions | Source(s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bajaj Finserv (BFL)** | **General High Risk Areas:** **Negative Area/OGL not allowed** to process unless the customer has CIBIL Score **>=720** and is **Bureau Thick**. | |
| **Bajaj Finserv (BFL)** | **100% BT Exclusion:** Paperless BT (100% BT), Govt 100% BT, and MTS 100% BT programs are **not allowed** in 14 specific locations: **Bhavnagar, Kurnool, Bulandshahr, Hazaribagh, Malda, Eluru, Rohtak, Dindigul, Jagdalpur, Sambalpur, Gorakhpur Up, Vellore, Faizabad, Kaithal**. | |

| **MAS Finance** | **Geo Limit:** Currently sourcing within **30 km** of the Little Mount Metro (Saidapet) location. | A severe geographical limitation based on a specific reference point. | |

### Summary of Other Hard Restrictions (General High Risk)

Beyond profiles and locations, lenders impose hard restrictions based on consumer behavior and status:

| Restriction Type | Conditions | Lender(s) | Source(s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Residential Status** | **No Funding for customer staying in PG, Hostel & guest house**. **Bachelor Accommodation not allowed** if staying with friends/colleagues in rented or co-provided housing (in Unlisted companies). **Rented with Friends / PG / Hostel / Resi Cum Office / Resi cum shop not allowed** (InCred SE policy). | BFL, InCred | |

PL/BL Enquiry **>=6 in last 1 month not allowed** (BFL). **5 enquiries in 30 days** is the limit before conditional counting (ABCL). | ABCL, BFL, InCred, TCL | |
| **Existing BFL Loans** | Existing BFL SALPL loan to be processed in BTTP only. **Parallel funding not allowed**. Live BFL PLCS customer **not to be funded** in SAL PL. | BFL | |

***
**Analogy for Negative Profiles:**

A negative profile list is like an airline's **Do Not Fly List**. While having a low credit score (CIBIL 650) might just put you on standby, engaging in a restricted profession (like gambling or being an On-Ship employee) or living in a forbidden area (a Negative Pincode) is like being on the absolute exclusion list. Even if your salary is high, the lender (the airline) views that profession or location as inherently too risky to allow boarding.

### Key Takeaways on Fees and Charges

1.  **Transparency in Foreclosure/Part-Payment:** **Piramal Finance** offers the most straightforward and attractive policy, explicitly stating **Nill Foreclosure Charges & Part-payment Charges**. Similarly, **Bandhan Bank** waives foreclosure charges for loan amounts of ₹10 lakhs and above.
2.  **Lock-in Periods and Waivers:** Both **Kotak Mahindra Bank** and **Poonawala (PFL)** define specific windows for closure:
    *   **Kotak** allows closure after **1 EMI**, though charges apply.
    *   **Poonawala** imposes a **6 EMI locking period**, after which foreclosure/part-payment is **0% if done using own funds**. If not from own funds (e.g., balance transfer to another bank), the charge is **4% + GST**.
3.  **Processing Fee Structure:** **ICICI** stands out for its complex, risk-based Processing Fee structure. Fees are usually fixed rupee amounts for larger loans (e.g., up to ₹9,999.00 for LA $\ge$ 5 Lakhs), but shift to a percentage basis for smaller loans (e.g., **1.50% of LA** for loans below ₹5 Lakhs).
4.  **Missing Data:** For major NBFCs like ABCL, BFL, TCL, and various newer lenders (Finnable, InCred, WeRize), the specific numerical details (percentages, fixed fee caps) for their standard processing, foreclosure, and part-payment charges are not documented in the provided policy excerpts.

These fees essentially act as toll booths on the customer's journey: Processing Fees are the initial entry toll, Foreclosure Fees are the exit toll for leaving early, and Part-Payment fees are the fee for stopping to partially unload debt along the way. Lenders like Piramal (offering Nill FC/PC) essentially offer a toll-free exit ramp, which is a major USP.

### Detailed Explanation of Requirements

#### 1. KYC: Digital vs. Physical Verification

While many lenders emphasize a "Digital Process", the underlying KYC/Verification processes vary:

*   **Waiver of Physical/Residential Checks:** Several lenders use compensating factors to waive physical checks:
    *   **Piramal Finance** waives Residence Verification if the customer owns their house.
    *   **Bajaj Finserv (BFL)** allows **VKYC** (Video KYC) to waive Geo Tagging requirements, particularly for high-salary or high-CIBIL customers with Home Loan tracks or long work experience.
*   **Mandatory Physical Checks (FI/Geo Tagging):**
    *   **InCred**'s Self-Employed policy strictly mandates **Physical FI** (Field Investigation) for both residence and business addresses.
    *   **BFL** mandates Geo tagging (location-based photography/verification by an on-roll employee) in specific high-risk scenarios or for high loan amounts (e.g., LA $\ge$ ₹20L).
    *   **Poonawala** requires **FI/Video PD** for loans exceeding ₹20 lakhs.

#### 2. Income Proof: Payslips and Bank Statements

The requirement for income documents often depends heavily on the program or risk segment:

*   **Payslips:** Payslip requirements range from **1 month** (BFL Super Green/Green, Chola, Kotak) to **3 months** (BFL Red/Amber, BFL Bureau No-Hit, Bandhan Bank).
    *   **Waivers:** **Aditya Birla Capital Ltd (ABCL)** stands out by stating **no salary slips required** if PF and OMC (Other Money Confirmation) details are available. **IDFC First Bank** waives payslips for loans up to ₹15 lakhs if salary validation is successful. BFL's NIP (No Payslip) Program is also an exception, relying solely on verified banking.
*   **Bank Statements:** The standard requirement is **3 months** (Bandhan Bank, BFL FUW/MTS, Chola). However, some lenders require a longer history for better risk assessment:
    *   **BFL** requires **6 months** banking in several programs (ABB, DOE 2, DOE 3) and requires checking loan repayment over **12 months** for Paperless BT.
    *   **WeRize** requires **1 Year Banking** history, with salary reflecting in the last 9 months.
    *   **InCred** requires **6 months** bank statements for SE applicants.

#### 3. Official Email Verification

Official email verification is increasingly important, often serving as a surrogate for employment stability and authenticity, or as a requirement to waive physical checks:

*   **Mandatory / Core Requirement:** **Bajaj Finserv (BFL)** mandates official email confirmation and domain check in the **Bureau No-Hit Program**, and for certain high-risk groups (Co-working profile employees, Bank Employees, specific large corporate employees).
*   **Waiver Factor:** **Piramal Finance** will waive Office Verification if the customer is "Working with the Official Mail domain".
*   **Poonawala (PFL)** treats the **Official email** as mandatory, requiring it to be captured in the system and confirmed via reply mail or OTP.
*   **Conditional Use:** **Bandhan Bank** requires official email confirmation for **Work From Home (WFH)** profiles.

In summary, for most standard lending products, **3 months of bank statements and 1 to 3 months of salary slips** are the foundational documentation requirements, and Official Email verification is generally treated as mandatory or a vital compensating factor. However, some NBFCs, like **ABCL** and **IDFC**, have introduced policies to waive the payslip requirement entirely based on digital income validation.






This detailed deep dive focuses exclusively on the available policy information for HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank, addressing the specific data points requested.

## 🔍 HDFC Bank Deep Dive

The HDFC Bank policy excerpt provides clear requirements for minimum salary based on category and account type, but the sources **do not explicitly state** the exact mathematical logic for the loan multiplier or the starting interest rates and processing fees.

### 1. Loan Multiplier

The source confirms that the loan multiplier is a mandatory part of the eligibility assessment but does not specify the numerical figure (e.g., 15 times, 20 times, or 27 times of salary).

*   **Multiplier Logic:** "**Foir and Multiplier both will be checked** and minimum of that will be sanctioned".

### 2. Minimum Net Monthly Salary (NTH)

The minimum salary requirement for HDFC Bank depends on the company classification (Super A, Cat A, B, C) and whether the applicant maintains an internal salary account (with HDFC Bank) or an external account.

*   **Super A, Cat A, Cat B (Internal Account):** Minimum salary is **₹25k**.
*   **Super A, Cat A, Cat B (External Account):** Minimum salary is **₹30k**.
*   **Cat C (Internal or External Account):** Minimum salary is **₹35k**.

### 3. Starting Interest Rate and Processing Fee

The HDFC Bank source **does not explicitly mention** the starting Interest Rate (ROI) or the Processing Fee structure.

## 🔍 ICICI Bank Deep Dive

The ICICI Bank documentation focuses heavily on tiered pricing based on risk, CIBIL score, and customer income segments. While it provides extremely specific details on interest rates and processing fees, it **does not specify** a minimum salary amount or FOIR limits.

### 1. Is there a specific Minimum Net Salary amount mentioned?

The ICICI documents **do not list an absolute minimum net salary** figure (e.g., ₹30,000) for a general application.

*   The pricing tables distinguish between customers with "Income $\ge$ 75K" and "Income < 75K" to determine the applicable interest rate and processing fee caps.
*   ICICI provides pricing tiers for very low loan amounts, down to **< 50K**.

### 2. What is the Loan Multiplier applied for Salaried employees?

The provided sources, which detail ICICI's ROI and PF structure, **do not mention or define any Loan Multiplier** applied to the net salary of salaried employees. Eligibility appears to be driven by CIBIL score, loan band, and risk segment.

### 3. What is the maximum FOIR allowed?

The ICICI Bank sources **do not specify the maximum Fixed Obligation to Income Ratio (FOIR)** allowed for salaried employees.

### ICICI Financial Charges (Contextual Data)

Although not directly requested in this section, the ICICI sources provide the following critical financial charge details:

*   **Lowest Interest Rate (ROI):** The lowest stated rate is a **Flat ROI Offer of 10.55%** for the ICICI Group and Infosys Group. For other segments, the lowest ROI starts at **10.60%** for high CIBIL (>770) and high LA ($\ge$ 20 Lakhs) customers.
*   **Processing Fee (PF):**
    *   For ICICI Group/Infosys Group: **Lower of Rs. 3,999 or 1.00% of LA**.
    *   For loans less than ₹5 Lakhs: **1.50% of LA**.
    *   For loans $\ge$ ₹20 Lakhs: Fixed fees apply, starting at **₹6,999.00** for the lowest risk band.

***
**Analogy:**

If HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank were two detailed product specification sheets, the multiplier and FOIR metrics are like the secret, proprietary efficiency ratings of the engine.

*   **HDFC Bank** openly publishes the size of the required driver (Minimum Salary) and confirms they check both the engine size (Multiplier) and the safety metrics (FOIR), but **they do not publish the exact formula or the top speed allowed (ROI)**.
*   **ICICI Bank** publishes a vast, complex pricing chart based on the driver's history (CIBIL score) and wealth (Income tiers), showing exactly how much they charge at every risk level. However, **they omit the proprietary engineering details (Multiplier and FOIR limits)** necessary to determine *how big* a loan they will initially approve.





The sources reconfirm that for the listed lenders, the calculation logic is primarily driven by the Fixed Obligation to Income Ratio (FOIR), Average Bank Balance (ABB) metrics, or internal Max EMI Logic, rather than a fixed multiplier of the Net Monthly Salary (NTH).

Here is the detailed extraction of the calculation logic or maximum FOIR limit for the requested lenders, including explicit statements where the multiplier is excluded:

| Lender | Loan Multiplier Found? | Maximum FOIR Allowed / Max Loan Calculation Logic | Supporting Source Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bandhan Bank** | **No Multiplier Stated.** | **FOIR Based:** Eligibility is determined by **"FOIR based on the salary irrespective of company categorization."**. The maximum FOIR percentage is not explicitly defined in the provided excerpts. | Loan amount up to 25 Lakhs (40 Lakhs for Doctors). |
| **Finnable** | **No Multiplier Stated.** | **FOIR/EMI Controlled:** Calculation logic is implicit, but applications are rejected due to "High EMI and overall financial obligation", implying a strict FOIR or Max EMI control. | Max loan amount capped at 10L. A client was rejected due to high EMI burden. |
| **IDFC First Bank** | **No Multiplier Stated.** | **FOIR Based (Upto 70%):** Loan amount calculation for loans **up to 9 lakhs is provided based on FOIR**. Max FOIR ranges based on salary: **50% to 70%**. | For CAT SA, A, B: 60% (<50k NTH) up to **70%** (>75k NTH). For CAT C, D, Unlisted: 50% (<40k NTH) up to **70%** (>75k NTH). |
| **InCred** | **No Multiplier Stated.** | **Max EMI Logic (Based on ABB):** For Self-Employed Non-Professionals, eligibility is based on **"Max EMI Logic."** This EMI is calculated using the **Average Bank Balance (ABB)**. | Rejections occur when ABB is too low or due to high obligations (a client was rejected with an FOIR of approximately 46%). |
| **MAS Finance** | **No Multiplier Stated.** | **FOIR Only (Upto 60%):** Policy explicitly states: "**Only FOIR basis approval**". Max FOIR ranges based on salary tiers: **30%** (18k-25k salary) up to **60%** (75k and above salary). | Deviation of 5 to 8% above the FOIR cap is possible based on profile. |
| **Muthoot** | **No Multiplier Stated.** | **FOIR Based (Upto 65%):** Eligibility is controlled by a graded FOIR based on income and residency status. Max FOIR is **65%** for salaries above ₹50k. | Lower salaries have lower caps: 40% (Rent) or 50% (Own) for 20k-30k salary, and 60% for 30k-50k salary. |
| **Poonawala (PFL)** | **No Multiplier Stated.** | **FOIR Based (Upto 80%):** Eligibility is the **"lower basis FOIR or the Loan requirement"**. Max FOIR for the lowest risk band (Very-Low risk segment) reaches **80%** for Super HNI. | FOIR ranges from **50%** (Cat E, Others segment) up to **80%** (Super A & Cat A, Super HNI). |
| **WeRize (Werize)** | **No Multiplier Stated.** | **Scorecard/FOIR Controlled:** Calculation relies on an internal **"app score"** model and FOIR threshold (a case was rejected due to "high FOIR exceeding their acceptable limit," stated at 58.9%). | Max loan eligibility can be severely limited (e.g., restricted to ₹30,000 for a client needing ₹200,000). |

### Additional Note on Multiplier Absence

It is important to contrast these findings with lenders that *do* use multipliers, such as Bajaj Finserv, Kotak Mahindra Bank, and Tata Capital.

For the lenders listed above (Bandhan, Finnable, IDFC, InCred, MAS, Muthoot, Poonawala, and WeRize), the documentation indicates they prioritize the **FOIR (Fixed Obligation to Income Ratio)** or an equivalent **Max EMI / ABB-based calculation** as the primary determinant of loan eligibility, rather than employing a simple "times salary" multiplier. The focus is on controlling the borrower's debt service capacity rather than their gross income leverage.

Based on a forensic search of the provided documents for HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank, here is the detailed information regarding their calculation logic, salary thresholds, and policy terminology.

## 🕵️‍♂️ Forensic Search Results for HDFC Bank & ICICI Bank

### 1. HDFC Bank

| Search Item | Finding | Source Detail |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **HDFC Multiplier** (Exact figure or illustration) | **Not Found.** | The policy explicitly states that the multiplier is checked, but the numerical value (e.g., 20x or 27x) or a sample loan calculation based on salary is **not available** in the provided excerpts. |
| **HDFC Multiplier Logic** (Terms) | **Explicitly checked.** | The document states: "**Foir and Multiplier both will be checked** and minimum of that will be sanctioned". |
| **Minimum Net Monthly Salary** (Explicit figure) | **Explicitly detailed, varies by category.** | Minimum salary for Super A, Cat A, Cat B is **₹25k for internal account** customers and **₹30k for external account** customers. Cat C customers require a minimum salary of **₹35k** for both internal and external accounts. |

### 2. ICICI Bank

The ICICI documents consist entirely of pricing tiers (ROI and PF) based on CIBIL score, loan amount, and broad income brackets (>$75K vs. <$75K)–. Annexures detailing operational logic (like FOIR or Multiplier) were not included in these excerpts.

| Search Item | Finding | Source Detail |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ICICI Minimum Net Salary** (Lowest salary mentioned) | **No explicit absolute minimum salary defined.** | The pricing tables use "Income $\ge$ 75K" and "Income < 75K" as the primary segmentation for ROI/PF determination. Crucially, pricing bands are listed for loan amounts as low as **< ₹50K**. This implies acceptance of income well below ₹75K, but the absolute minimum required NTH (e.g., ₹20,000 or ₹30,000) is **not stated**. |
| **ICICI Minimum Income Definition** | **Not Found.** | The provided ICICI documentation, which focuses on pricing tables, does not contain a "Definitions" section or an explicit "Minimum Income" standard–. |
| **ICICI Multiplier / FOIR** (Logic or fine print) | **No mention of FOIR or Multiplier.** | The ICICI documents **do not contain terms** such as "FOIR based eligibility," "Max Multiplier," or "Eligibility Calculation." The documents focus exclusively on pricing tiers (ROI and PF) applied after eligibility is determined by segment, income tier, and CIBIL score–. |

In summary, for HDFC Bank, we confirm that both Multiplier and FOIR are checked, but the calculation values remain proprietary in these sources. For ICICI Bank, the policy is heavily focused on CIBIL/Risk-based pricing, and the mechanics of eligibility (Multiplier or FOIR) are not disclosed in the provided rate tables.






Based on a forensic search of the policy documents for Aditya Birla Capital Ltd (ABCL), IDFC First Bank, and Bandhan Bank, the sources do not provide an explicit **Loan Multiplier** (X times the monthly income) or an illustrative calculation derived from salary. Instead, eligibility is determined primarily by the FOIR constraint or fixed caps.

Here is the breakdown of the calculation logic for each lender:

### 1. Aditya Birla Capital Ltd (ABCL)

ABCL's policy focuses on capping loan amounts based on the funding program or on the applicant's existing debt and housing track, rather than using a simple salary multiplier.

| Search Item | Finding / Policy Logic | Supporting Source Detail |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Multiplier Logic** | **Not Found.** No text restricts the maximum loan amount to a specific multiple of the monthly income. | The documents list loan amounts from 1 L to 50 L, but do not link this directly to a multiplier calculation. |
| **Max Loan Amount Calculation / Example** | **Loan amount capped based on program/employer type.** | Funding for employees of **Proprietorship, LLP, or Partnership firms** is capped at **₹5 L**. The **Auto Loan Surrogate** program is capped at **₹5 L**, and the **HL (Home Loan) surrogate** is capped at **₹7 L**. |
| **FOIR as Primary Limit** | **FOIR is the central eligibility mechanism.** | The FOIR ranges from **40% to 75%** based on salary and Home Loan (HL) track. ABCL also allows **100% FOIR capping** for the Paperless BT program, provided tracks and seasoning criteria are met. |
| **Rejection Context** | **Rejections are based on internal score norms, not multiplier.** | Client rejections cited the failure to meet the app score norms, or salary being below the minimum threshold, not an explicit multiplier failure. |

### 2. IDFC First Bank

IDFC First Bank explicitly uses FOIR as the basis for loan calculations for smaller amounts, and the documents contain no mention of a traditional salary multiplier.

| Search Item | Finding / Policy Logic | Supporting Source Detail |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Multiplier Logic** | **Not Found.** Eligibility is driven by FOIR and compliance checks. | The policy states: "**Upto 9 lakhs we are providing loan amount based on FOIR for all categories**". |
| **Max Loan Amount Calculation / Example** | **Loan calculation is based on FOIR tiers linked to salary.** | The FOIR limits increase with salary: up to **60%** for NTH < ₹50k, up to **65%** for ₹50k–₹75k, and up to **70%** for NTH > ₹75k (for Cat SA, A, B). |
| **Illustrative Calculation** | **Not Found.** | There is no sample calculation (e.g., "If NTH is 40,000, max EMI is...") provided in the excerpts. |
| **Minimum Salary** | **₹20k Mandatory for all Listed companies**. | |

### 3. Bandhan Bank

Bandhan Bank's policy confirms the calculation method relies on FOIR but does not state a numerical FOIR percentage or a multiplier.

| Search Item | Finding / Policy Logic | Supporting Source Detail |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Multiplier Logic** | **Not Found.** Loan calculation is based on FOIR, irrespective of company category. | The policy states: "**FOIR based on the salary irrespective of company categorization**". |
| **Max Loan Amount Calculation / Example** | **Not Found.** No formula or example calculation illustrating how the final loan amount is derived is provided. | Loan amount is capped at **up to ₹25 Lakhs** (and up to **₹40 Lakhs for Doctors**). |
| **Minimum Salary** | **Gross Salary considered for login eligibility—₹25k for CAT A & B & GOVT**; ₹40k for CAT B. | |

In conclusion, for these three lenders, the logic presented in the sources emphasizes limiting debt exposure via **FOIR (Fixed Obligation to Income Ratio)** rather than leveraging income via a fixed multiplier. The absence of a multiplier suggests they use the FOIR constraint, possibly combined with internal underwriting models, to determine the maximum loan principal corresponding to the allowed monthly EMI.







Based on the specific documents provided, a dedicated "Schedule of Charges" or "Interest Rate Policy" section containing the exact starting ROI or Processing Fees (PF) was **not found** for Axis Finance, HDFC Bank, Tata Capital, or IDFC First Bank.

The sources do, however, reveal certain financial flexibility or charge information for some of these lenders:

| Lender | Starting Interest Rate (ROI) | Processing Fee (PF) | Supporting Source Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Axis Finance** | **Not Specified.** (Specific starting rate/range is missing.) | **Not Specified.** | The policy confirms **ROI waiver flexibility is Available** for all programs (Super Edge, PL Flexi, All in One, PL Shift Plus). Key USPs claim "**Transparent terms with no hidden charges**". |
| **HDFC Bank** | **Not Specified.** | **Not Specified.** | The document confirms that **Multiplier** and **FOIR** are checked to determine eligibility but provides no figures for ROI or PF. |
| **Tata Capital (TCL)** | **Not Specified.** | **Not Specified.** | The document extensively details Multiplier Grids and the **Max FOIR of 75%** (marketed as "Best in PL Industry"), but does not provide the starting ROI or PF percentages. |
| **IDFC First Bank** | **Not Specified.** | **Not Specified.** | IDFC policy defines strict FOIR tiers (ranging from **50% to 70%** based on salary and category) for loans up to 9 lakhs, but the starting ROI or PF is **not detailed**. |

### Contextual Financial Findings from Other Lenders

While the specific rates for the requested four lenders are missing from the excerpts, other lenders in the sources provide examples of ROI ranges, which helps contextualize typical market rates:

*   **Piramal Finance:** States rates starting from **11.99%** with a PF of **1.5% to 2.5%**.
*   **Bandhan Bank:** Rates start from **10.50%** up to 16.99% maximum for all types of customers.
*   **Finnable:** States an Interest Rate range of **19.99% to 28.99%**.
*   **ICICI Bank:** Offers a flat ROI of **10.55%** for ICICI/Infosys Group employees, with other segments starting slightly higher (e.g., 10.60% for high CIBIL scores and large loan amounts). PF varies significantly, but can be as low as **Lower of Rs. 3,999 or 1.00% of LA** for certain groups.
