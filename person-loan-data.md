## Prompt 2: Financial Ratios (FOIR)

### Explanation of the FOIR (Fixed Obligation to Income Ratio) Calculation Logic

The **Fixed Obligation to Income Ratio (FOIR)** is a critical metric used by lenders to assess a customer's repayment capacity. It essentially measures the percentage of a customer's Net Take Home (NTH) salary or Net Monthly Income (NMI) that is already committed to servicing existing debt obligations.

The final loan eligibility is determined by taking the minimum amount derived from three calculations: **FOIR, Multiplier, and Policy Capping**.

For Bajaj Finserv, the FOIR cap is established by considering the maximum amount a customer can allocate towards fixed obligations (EMIs) after accounting for estimated household expenses necessary for sustenance.

### 1. What is the maximum allowed FOIR percentage? (e.g., 50%, 60%?)

The maximum allowed FOIR percentage generally ranges from **70% to 75%** for high-income or low-risk segments, although specific Balance Transfer (BT) programs may allow up to 100%.

*   **75% FOIR:** This is explicitly stated as the maximum allowed by Piramal Finance and TATA Capital, which deems it the "Best in PL Industry". Kotak Mahindra Bank allows **75% FOIR** for customers with live Home Loan (HL) tracks.
*   **70% FOIR:** Bajaj Finserv allows up to 70% for high-income segments (>1L salary). Axis Finance generally caps FOIR at **70%**. IDFC allows up to **70%** for listed company categories SA, A, B, C, D, and unlisted with salary >75k.
*   **75% Maximum Range:** Aditya Birla Capital states its FOIR Grid ranges from **40% to 75%** based on salary and HL track.
*   **100% FOIR:** Certain specific Balance Transfer programs permit 100% FOIR capping:
    *   Aditya Birla Capital’s Paperless BT program has **100% FOIR capping**.
    *   Bajaj Finserv’s Paperless BT program is explicitly mentioned as allowing 100% FOIR capping.

### 2. Does the FOIR limit change based on the salary bracket?

**Yes, the FOIR limit consistently changes based on the salary bracket and whether the applicant has a Home Loan (HL) or owned property track.** Generally, higher income brackets are permitted a higher FOIR percentage, reflecting the assumption that absolute household expenditure takes up a smaller percentage of a larger salary.

Here are examples of how FOIR varies by salary:

| Lender | Salary Bracket | FOIR Cap (General/No HL) | FOIR Cap (With HL/Owned House) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bajaj Finserv** | <50k | **60%** | **60%** (Lower FOIR for lower income assumed due to minimum absolute household expenditure). |
| | >=50K – 1L | **65%** | **70%** (Higher FOIR allowed with HL track as customer may not bear rental expenses). |
| | >1L | **70%** | **70%** |
| **TATA Capital** | > 25k & < 50K | **60%** | N/A |
| | >50K & 75K | **65%** | N/A |
| | > 75K | **75%** | N/A |
| **IDFC** (Cat SA, A, B) | <50k | **60%** | N/A |
| | 50k - 75k | **65%** | N/A |
| | >75k | **70%** | N/A |
| **MAS Financial** | 18K - 25K | **30%** | N/A |
| | 75K - ABOVE | **60%** | N/A |

### 3. What existing obligations are counted? (Credit card minimum dues, existing EMIs, rent?)

Fixed obligations that reduce the customer's disposable income are counted in the FOIR calculation.

#### Existing EMIs and Fixed Loans

*   **Existing EMIs** serviced by the applicant are included in monthly obligations.
*   **Loan EMIs getting over in 6 months are explicitly excluded** from consideration by Bajaj Finserv. Muthoot policy states that loans with less than 6 months EMI remaining are **Not Obligated**.
*   **Under Construction Home Loans:** If a customer is paying pre-EMI, Bajaj Finserv takes the **full EMI as the obligation** (based on the sanction amount, not the pre-EMI amount).

#### Credit Card and Overdraft Obligations

Lenders typically obligate a percentage of the outstanding amount or use a rule based on the NTH salary:

*   **Bajaj Finserv:** **5% of Credit Card Outstanding** is obligated *if* the total Credit outstanding is **greater than** the Net Salary amount. If the total credit outstanding is lower than the salary amount, it is *not* obligated. **5% of Overdraft O/s** (as per CIBIL) is also included.
    *   *Note:* The 5% obligation is considered the industry standard minimum amount due (MAD).
*   **HDFC:** **5%** of Card Outstanding will be obligated if the card outstanding is **greater than NTH**.
*   **Poonawalla:** **5% CC obligation** is applied. Credit card outstanding should not be more than 4 times of Net Monthly Salary (with deviation up to 6 times allowed).
*   **Bandhan Bank:** If the total credit card outstanding is **above 3 times of salary**, **3% Obligation is considered**. If it is less than 3 times of salary, the obligation is Nil.

#### Secured Loans (Gold/LAS/Property Loans)

*   **Gold Loan/LAS/Loan Against FD:** Monthly interest must be obligated. This interest is calculated at:
    *   **15% p.a.** for Gold Loan / Agriculture loan / Kisan Credit Card.
    *   **12% p.a.** for Loan Against FD (LAFD) / Loan Against Securities (LAS).
*   **Bandhan Bank and Piramal Finance** explicitly state **Nil obligation** for Gold Loan.

#### Rental Payments

Rent payments themselves are not typically counted as fixed debt obligations in the FOIR formula (which primarily measures debt-to-income). However, the residential status often influences the allowable FOIR limit:

*   **Rental Income:** Rental income can be *added* to the applicant’s income for eligibility calculations, subject to restrictions (e.g., 80% of the last 6 months' average monthly rental receipts, capped at 15% of the average net salary for Bajaj Finserv).
*   **FOIR Adjustment based on Residence:** Muthoot Policy shows that for a salary band of 20k to 30K, the FOIR is restricted to **40% for Rent** status, but **50% for Own House** status. This implies that housing status directly impacts the FOIR ceiling, recognizing that those paying rent have higher implicit non-debt fixed expenses.

***
*Analogy:* Think of the FOIR calculation as checking the customer's financial "bandwidth" for new debt. If their net salary is the full width of a radio frequency, their Fixed Obligations (EMIs, Credit Card Minimum Dues) are the channels already being used. The FOIR rule determines the maximum percentage of the total bandwidth that can be occupied by all these fixed channels, ensuring enough space (disposable income) is left for daily living expenses. Lenders allow high-earners more bandwidth (higher FOIR) because their baseline living costs consume a smaller proportion of their income.





The following response addresses your queries regarding Employer Categorization in Personal Loans and the LTV guidelines for Home Loans, based on the policy documents provided.

***

## Prompt 3: Employer Categorization

The employer category is a fundamental determinant of risk, loan size, and eligibility criteria for Personal Loans.

### 1. Are companies classified into Categories (e.g., Super A, Cat A, Cat B, Unlisted)?

Yes, companies are extensively classified into various tiers, which directly influence the eligibility criteria, maximum loan amount, and multiplier applied.

**Common Categorization Systems:**

*   **Tiers/Grades (A, B, C, D, E):** Several lenders use tiered systems based on company reputation, size, or industry:
    *   **Poonawalla:** Uses **Super A, Cat A, Cat B, Cat C, Cat D, and Cat E**. **Cat E** employees generally include those whose employers are not categorized in the above tiers and require specific stability norms.
    *   **Chola:** Uses **Category A, B, C, D**, and **Unlisted**.
    *   **TATA Capital:** Uses **Super Cat A (SCAT-A), Cat A, Cat B, Cat C**, and **Unapproved Companies (CAT-U)**.
    *   **HDFC:** Uses **Super A, Cat A, Cat B, and Cat C**.
    *   **IDFC:** Uses **CAT SA, A, B, C, D, and Unlisted**.
*   **Qualitative & Risk Categories (Bajaj Finserv):** Bajaj Finserv uses qualitative categories such as **Diamond, Platinum, Gold, Silver, Blue, Bronze, and Pvt Ltd Company** to define eligible companies for certain large loan amounts. They also rely on **Risk Segments** (Super Green, Green, Amber, Red, Dark Red) determined by internal models and PL/CIBIL scores.
*   **Government/PSU:** Government employees (Central Govt Entity, State Govt Entity, PSU) are often treated as a separate, low-risk category (**Govt Ratna** or similar).

### 2. How does the loan multiplier change based on the company category?

The loan multiplier (which determines the maximum loan amount based on a multiple of the Net Take Home salary) significantly decreases as the company category moves down the risk ladder (e.g., from Super A to Unlisted/Cat C).

**Examples of Multiplier Variation:**

| Lender/Category | NTH Salary Band | Multiplier (X times NTH) | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **TATA Capital (Super CAT A / TGE)** | > ₹75,000 | **27x** | |
| **TATA Capital (CAT C)** | > ₹75,000 | **18x** | |
| **TATA Capital (CAT-U / Unapproved)** | > ₹75,000 | **15x** | |
| **Bajaj Finserv (Listed)** | >= ₹75,000 (Super Green) | Up to **24x** | |
| **Bajaj Finserv (Unlisted)** | All Segments | Flat **10x** | |
| **Kotak Mahindra (CAT AA/A)** | > ₹75,000 | **32x** | |
| **Kotak Mahindra (CAT D)** | > ₹75,000 | **19x** | |
| **Chola (Cat A)** | > ₹75,000 (73-84M tenor) | **26x** | |
| **Chola (Unlisted)** | > ₹75,000 (73-84M tenor) | **14x** | |

**Key Takeaways on Multiplier:**

1.  **Risk Segmentation Overrides:** For Bajaj Finserv, the multiplier is a matrix where **Risk Segment (Super Green, Amber, Red)** and **Salary Band** interact, but the **Company Category (Listed/Unlisted)** sets the boundary. For instance, Unlisted companies are capped at a flat **10x** multiplier regardless of the customer's risk segment.
2.  **Higher Caps for Top Tiers:** Premium categories (Super CAT A, TGE, Cat AA) consistently receive the highest multipliers, sometimes reaching **32x** (Kotak) or **27x** (TATA Capital) for high earners.
3.  **Loan Type Impact:** Loan products may have different multiplier rules. For instance, the DOE1—Unlisted Program by Bajaj has a max multiplier of **10x**.

### 3. Are there any 'Negative Profiles' or 'Negative Employer Types' that are auto-rejected?

Yes, all policy documents outline specific profiles, industries, and employee types that are restricted or outright **not allowed** in any program, due to elevated risk or compliance concerns.

**Profiles/Occupations Auto-Rejected (Bajaj Finserv, Poonawalla, Bandhan Bank):**

*   **Blue-Collar/Entry-Level Profiles:** Bajaj Finserv explicitly prohibits **Class IV employees** and profiles like **Drivers, Sweepers, Peons, Watchman, Office boy, Lift Operator, Courier delivery boy, and Security guards** in any program. Bandhan Bank also lists similar profiles (e.g., Drivers, Sweepers, Peons, MTS, Chaprasi, Mali) as **Negative Profile** and not allowed.
*   **Defense and Enforcement:** **Police and other related enforcement organizations** (BRDO, BRO, BSF, CRPF, RPF, etc.) are **Not Allowed** by Bajaj Finserv. Poonawalla also lists Defense profiles that do not fulfill specific criteria as negative. Sourcing Defense profiles is **Not Allowed** in the Prime market for Bajaj.
*   **Legal/Political:** **Judge/Lawyers** and **Politically connected individuals/ Foreign National/ Non Residential Indian** are **Not Allowed**.
*   **Sales/Commission-Based:** Lenders generally reject cases where the job role is purely **commission-based**.
*   **Specific Industries:** Multi-level marketing companies, Panchayats, Media Companies (like Zee news, Star India Ltd, etc.), Mines, Shipping (on ship employees), Internet gambling, chit fund, Nidhi, lottery, SPA / Beauty Parlours & Saloon, Co-operative societies & Co-operative Banks, Online Gaming, Jewellers (Gold/Diamond related), and Auto dealers (except ABB program) are all **Not Allowed** in Bajaj Finserv programs.
*   **Service/Staffing Agencies:** **Unlisted Manpower Outsourcing/ Recruitment/ Staffing companies** are **Not Allowed**.
*   **Educational Profiles:** **Government School Teachers** are **Not Allowed** in all locations of West Bengal. Unlisted School/Colleges are also **not allowed** under Profile approval.

**Specific Employee/Company Status Restrictions:**

*   **Company Structure:** Contractual employees are generally **Not Allowed**. Employees of proprietorships, partnerships, HUF, Trusts and co-operative societies are often restricted from funding, though some programs like the ABB Program allow them with strict criteria (e.g., EPFO strength >=30).
*   **Current Status:** Employees serving **notice period, PIP, DAC, or Pre-PIP** are excluded from Employee Loan policies.

## Prompt 4: Home Loan - LTV & Property

The sources provided contain extensive policy documents covering **Personal Loans** (including salaried, self-employed, balance transfer, etc.) and reference Home Loan (HL) tracks only as a mitigating factor for Personal Loan eligibility.

**The provided documents DO NOT contain the detailed policy guidelines necessary to answer your query regarding Home Loan LTV (Loan to Value) ratios or specific restrictions on property types.**

Therefore, I cannot provide details regarding:

1.  **Max LTV for loans up to 30 Lakhs** [N/A].
2.  **Max LTV for loans above 75 Lakhs** [N/A].
3.  **Restrictions on property type** (e.g., Gram Panchayat properties, older buildings, resale vs. builder purchase) [N/A].

The eligibility criteria mentioned in the sources are exclusively for Personal Loan products.





This response addresses your queries regarding Home Loan eligibility calculations and required documentation by drawing heavily on the comprehensive policies provided for Personal Loans, noting where specific Home Loan policy details are absent.

***

## Prompt 5: Home Loan - Income Eligibility

The sources provided are predominantly Personal Loan (PL) policies, which often reference Home Loan (HL) tracks to determine PL risk or eligibility. While a full Home Loan eligibility calculation framework (which typically differs significantly from PL calculations) is not present, the sources contain detailed rules on income inclusion, co-applicant clubbing, and maximum tenures used in loan assessment.

### 1. Can we include variable pay/incentives in the income calculation?

Yes, variable pay, incentives, and certain other income sources can be included in the net income calculation, subject to strict conditions regarding frequency and limits:

*   **Incentives and Bonuses:**
    *   **Bajaj Finserv** policy allows for the inclusion of incentives. **Monthly incentives** are considered based on the average of the last three months, but **only if** they were received in *each* of those three months. **Quarterly incentives** are considered by averaging the last two quarters and dividing by six, but *only if* received in *each* of the last two quarters. Arrears and overtime are excluded from income.
    *   **Aditya Birla Capital** policy states that **monthly and quarterly incentives/bonus** will be calculated for eligibility.
    *   **Poonawalla** specifies that monthly incentive/quarterly variable pay can be considered, but the add back must not exceed **25% of the Net Take Home (NTH) salary**.
    *   **TATA Capital** allows **70% of the average of the last two Gross Bonus** amounts to be incorporated, provided the bonuses are regular in nature (annual or half-yearly) and the bonus amount does not exceed **15% of the Net Monthly Income (NMI)**.
    *   **Kotak Mahindra Bank** specifically includes **Bonus, Incentive, Rental income, [and] Pension** along with NTH to increase loan eligibility.

*   **Rental Income:**
    *   **Aditya Birla Capital** considers **50% of rental income** for eligibility.
    *   **Bajaj Finserv** allows **monthly rental income** received by the applicant to be clubbed, subject to documentation (Rental Agreement) and continuous reflection in the bank statement for the last six months. However, the considered rental income is capped at **15% of the applicant's average net salary**.

*   **Under Construction HL Adjustment:** In scenarios where a Home Loan is under construction and the customer is paying pre-EMI, **Bajaj Finserv** allows the net salary (considered for eligibility) to be **increased by a flat 10% for every year** required for completion, capped at a maximum of 20%. This acts as a proxy salary increment to mitigate the higher obligation of the full EMI being considered.

### 2. What is the logic for adding a Co-Applicant? Whose income can be clubbed? (Spouse, Parents, Siblings?)

The income of relatives can be clubbed through co-applicant policies, primarily focused on immediate family residing at the same address, which increases overall loan eligibility based on the combined income:

*   **Allowed Relationships for Clubbing:**
    *   **Spouse and Parents:** **Bajaj Finserv** explicitly permits co-applicants to be **only spouse or parents**.
    *   **Husband, Wife, Father, Mother, Son:** **MAS Financial Services** states that income can be clubbed from "husband and wife, father son, mother son".
*   **Conditions for Clubbing:**
    *   **Bajaj Finserv** mandates that the Applicant and financial Co-Applicant must be **residing at the same residence**. The co-applicant must meet minimum salary requirements (e.g., salary should not be below ₹25k in Prime locations) and the combined net salary must meet specific thresholds (e.g., combined NTH of ₹60,000 p.m. or ₹70,000 p.m. in Prime locations).
    *   **HDFC** noted that for a joint Home Loan, if the **joint person's income and EMI clearance statement** are provided, the HL will not be obligated on the primary applicant.
    *   **Poonawalla** permits the **clubbing of Co-Applicant salary**, provided the co-applicant fulfills all the required policy norms.
*   *Note:* Siblings are generally not explicitly listed among the clubbing options in these sources, which focus heavily on nuclear family units (spouse, parents, children).

### 3. What is the maximum tenure allowed?

Maximum tenures for term loans generally range from **72 months (6 years) to 96 months (8 years)**, depending on the lender, product, and customer's salary:

*   **96 Months (8 Years):** **Bajaj Finserv** allows a maximum tenure of **96 months** for Term Loan and Dropline Flexi products, specifically for cases where the salary is **>=50k**. Hybrid Flexi products also offer up to 96 months. **Aditya Birla Capital** allows **96 months** for Overdraft (OD) cases only, with term loans capped at 84 months.
*   **84 Months (7 Years):** This tenure is widely available across multiple lenders/programs:
    *   **Bajaj Finserv** allows Term Loan/Dropline Flexi up to 84 months in specific 100% BT programs.
    *   **IDFC** offers 72M / **84M** tenure for eligible customers.
    *   **Axis Finance** programs (Super Edge, PL Flexi, PL Shift Plus) offer eligible tenure up to **84 months**.
*   **72 Months (6 Years):** This is the maximum standard tenure for many Personal Loan products, especially for lower-tier categories or lower salaries (e.g., TATA Capital maximum tenure for Cat B/C is 60 months, but 72 months for Super Cat A/Govt). **Piramal Finance** offers tenure from 12 to 72 months.

***

## Prompt 6: Documentation Requirements

The documentation required for loan login varies based on the customer's risk profile (Super Green vs. Amber/Red) and the program type (Full Underwriting vs. No Payslip).

### 1. KYC Documents (Is Aadhaar/PAN mandatory?)

KYC documents are mandatory for all loans, and **PAN validation is a core requirement**.

*   **PAN Mandatory:** **PAN verification** is mandatory for all cases. The PAN must be checked against NSDL records, and the name must match the application.
*   **Aadhaar Verification:** Identity checks often involve the use of **EPAN** (which links PAN/Aadhaar details) through the NSDL website. For certain programs (like Bureau No-Hit), EPAN is mandatory, and the mobile number validation via Karza is required.
*   **General Requirement:** Lenders like **Bandhan Bank** and **WeRize** generically require "KYC documents".

### 2. Income Documents (How many months of Payslips? How many months of Bank Statements?)

The amount of documentation depends heavily on the borrower's risk segment:

| Document | Requirement (Full Underwriting) | Exceptions / Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Payslips** | **3 months** for Amber/Red segments and for programs like Government (SAL GOV) or Unlisted LLP. | **1 month** is required for Super Green & Green segments (low risk). **No salary slips required** in NIP (No Payslip Program) or in all Aditya Birla Category profiles if PF & OMC (Online Mail Confirmation) is validated. |
| **Bank Statements** | **Minimum 3 months** is the baseline for most programs. | **6 months** is required for higher-risk profiles (ABB Program), and is standard for confirming continuous income streams like rental payments or for NIP/DOE programs involving bank verification. **WeRize** requires **1 Year Banking** (min 9 months salary credit). |
| **Salary Credit Proof** | Bank statements must show salary credits on **regular dates** (span of 5 working days fluctuation allowed). Salary credits must be only through **direct mode** and not cash/cheque. | For Central Govt employees, payslip verification links (e.g., PFMS, TRACES) are used as alternative confirmation. |

### 3. Property Documents (for Home Loan)

The provided sources **do not contain a definitive list of property documents** required for the origination of a Home Loan product, as they focus on Personal Loan policies.

*   *Note:* The only related documents mentioned are those required to mitigate PL risk, such as the **Agreement to Sale** (to validate possession date for an Under Construction Home Loan), or an **Electricity bill in the name of the applicant** (used as proof of Owned House status for Geo tagging waivers).

### 4. Are there any specific formats required (e.g., PDF only)?

Yes, digital and authenticated formats are highly prioritized, and physical verification methods are becoming restricted.

*   **Digital Verification Mandatory:** Most lenders mandate digital verification methods, especially in high-volume or specific risk programs:
    *   **Account Aggregator (AA)**
    *   **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**
    *   **Perfios (Net-Banking or PDF Perfios)**
*   **Physical/Manual Restrictions:**
    *   **Covert verification** (used to cross-check salary details from the bank) is **Not Allowed** in certain segments, such as DOE 3 or when Perfios Net Banking/AA is available.
    *   For Poonawalla’s Cat E employees, **PDF Banking is mandatory**.
*   **Digital Login Focus:** **Aditya Birla Capital** emphasizes a **Digital process** from login to disbursement.
*   **Physical Signoffs:** When physical documents are used (e.g., Salary Certificate in Growth locations), they must be on **company letterhead, duly signed and stamped with company seal in original**.





This detailed response addresses your queries regarding negative rules and restrictions for Personal Loans, and the specific policies governing Balance Transfer (BT) processes.

***

## Prompt 7: Negative Profiles & Locations

## Prompt 8: Balance Transfer & Top-Up

Balance Transfer (BT) allows customers to close existing high-cost loans using a new loan, and policies are designed to ensure the customer has a history of reliable repayment on the old loan before BT is executed.

### 1. Minimum number of EMIs paid on the existing loan

The minimum seasoning required for a loan to be eligible for Balance Transfer (BT) is typically **6 months (MOB)**, though exceptions exist for certain banks and high-risk products.

*   **Standard Minimum Seasoning (6 MOB):**
    *   For **Normal PL BT** (Bajaj Finserv), a minimum **6 MOB seasoning** is required for the loan being transferred.
    *   **Poonawalla (Non App PL BT):** Minimum **6 EMI served** should be completed.
    *   **Muthoot:** Other Loan BT allowed if **3 months EMI should be completed**. For App Loans BT, **6 Months** completion is required.
*   **Higher Seasoning (12 MOB):**
    *   Bajaj Finserv requires a minimum of **12 MOB seasoning** for BT loans originating from **Standard Chartered Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, and HSBC Bank**.
    *   Aditya Birla Capital’s Paperless BT program requires **12 MOB cleared** on the loan tracks to be transferred.
    *   The BT loan (source bank loan) must have served a minimum of **12 MOB**.
*   **Immediate BT (1 MOB):**
    *   IDFC First Bank allows BT after **1 month EMI completion** for loans from **AXIS BANK, ICICI BANK, BAJAJ FLEXI OD, HDFC & HDFC jumbo**.
*   **Repayment History Condition:** For Paperless BT (Bajaj Finserv), the customer must have **No DPD** in the BT loan in the last 12 months, and **No 30+ DPD ever** in the BT bank loan.

### 2. Is a Top-Up loan allowed along with BT? If yes, what is the cap?

Yes, a Top-Up loan is commonly allowed along with Balance Transfer (BT), provided the total loan amount remains within the customer's maximum eligibility limit calculated via the FOIR and multiplier grids.

*   **Top-Up Calculation (Bajaj Finserv):**
    *   For the **Paperless BT** program, the maximum allowed funding is the **Original Finance amount of the BT loan + 5%**.
    *   Foreclosure charges (up to 5% of the BT Loan Amount) can also be added if the BT bank POS plus foreclosure charges is higher than the BT loan amount.
    *   For **Top-Up to an existing BFL SALPL or BFL/BFSD unsecured loan**, it is allowed after **4 MOB** only under full underwriting norms. However, in specific BT programs (Paperless BT, Employee loan, MTS), a **minimum of 6 MOB** should be completed.
*   **General Top-Up Allowance:** Poonawalla allows a maximum BT (mixture of 3 PL max with 6 months vintage, 3 App loans with recent also ok). The final loan amount depends on the **Loan/FOIR grid applicable as per main policy**.
*   **Axis Finance** programs (PL Flexi, PL Shift Plus) offer **Pure BT as well as top up flexibility**.

### 3. Is the FOIR calculation different for BT cases?

Yes, the FOIR calculation logic changes in BT cases primarily by **excluding the closing obligations**, but it also introduces specific, stricter FOIR caps for highly leveraged customers.

*   **Exclusion of Obligations:** If a customer is transferring a Personal Loan (PL) or Credit Card (CC) outstanding, the EMIs or minimum dues of those specific loans being taken over are **not considered as obligations** for calculating the new loan's eligibility. TATA Capital explicitly states, "There is no EMI obligation on the credit cards from which we have taken BT".
*   **Stricter FOIR Caps for High Leverage (Bajaj Finserv):** In Normal BT and CC BT cases, if $>=3$ PL tracks (including BFL) are found in the bureau and the customer has **NO Home Loan (HL), then the FOIR is restricted to 55%**. This is a punitive measure against high unsecured leverage.
*   **Liberalized FOIR Caps (Aditya Birla Capital):** The Paperless BT program offers **100% FOIR capping**, signifying a highly liberal approach for verified BT cases.
*   **FOIR Determined by Policy (Poonawalla):** The Loan/FOIR grid applicable for BT is governed by the main policy and the customer's income/risk segment. For instance, a Cat A/Super HNI earning >₹2.5L gets **80% FOIR**, while an applicant in Cat E earning 30K-50K gets **50% FOIR**.

***
*Analogy:* Think of a Balance Transfer (BT) like trading in an old, heavy backpack (the existing loan) for a new, larger suitcase (the new loan + top-up). The FOIR calculation for the new suitcase ignores the weight of the old backpack you are discarding, making it easier to qualify for a larger total volume (the top-up). However, if you've done this trade-in process too often recently without proving long-term stability (i.e., multiple prior PLs without a Home Loan track), the bank applies a strict limit (like the 55% FOIR cap) to prevent you from filling the new suitcase completely with high-risk debt.
