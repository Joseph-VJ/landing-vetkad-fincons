This detailed response draws on the varied policies across multiple lenders regarding minimum net monthly salary (NTH) requirements, which are frequently differentiated based on city tier or internal risk classification of the location.

The financial sources utilize various terms for geographical classification, such as Prime/Annex, Growth, Metro, Urban, Semi-Urban, Rural, Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3+.

Based on the synthesis of these policies, here is an estimated representation of minimum net salary requirements by city tier, keeping in mind that actual requirements are highly dependent on the specific lender, the customer's profile (e.g., company category), and the loan program:

```json
"min_salary_by_tier": {
  "tier_1": 30000,
  "tier_2": 25000,
  "tier_3": 20000
}
```

## Detailed Overview of City-Tier Based Minimum Salary Norms

Lender policies show significant variation in the minimum required net monthly salary (NTH) based on location, generally dividing cities into higher-requirement tiers (Metro/Prime) and lower-requirement tiers (Tier 2/Growth/Tier 3+).

### 1. Metro/Tier 1 Cities (High Requirement Zones)

This category generally includes major metropolitan areas such as Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chennai, Kolkata, and Pune. The salary norms in these key locations tend to be the highest.

| Lender / Location Classification | Minimum Net Monthly Salary (NTH) | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bajaj Finserv (Prime & Annex)** | **₹50,000** |
| **Bajaj Finserv (DOE 2 - Risk Program, Prime)** | **₹1,00,000** |
| **L&T Finance (Mumbai)** | **₹35,000** |
| **L&T Finance (Delhi, Bangalore, Pune, Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Ahmedabad)** | **₹25,000** |
| **Poonawalla Fincorp** | **₹30,000** (Minimum NTH for all categories) |
| **Axis Finance (Metro - CAT A, B, C)** | **₹40,000** (Revised Norm) |
| **Axis Finance (Metro - CAT D, U)** | **₹1,00,000** (Revised Norm) |
| **HDFC Bank (External A/C, CAT A/B)** | **₹30,000** |
| **HDFC Bank (External/Internal A/C, CAT C)** | **₹35,000** |
| **Finnable (Tier 1 Locations)** | **₹20,000** (Applicable in Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Delhi, Mumbai, Pune) |

**Key Insights for Metro/Tier 1:**

*   **Bajaj Finserv** applies the highest general minimum NTH requirement in its **Prime and Annex locations** at **₹50,000**.
*   For customers in high-risk categories (like CAT D or U) in Metro locations, **Axis Finance** requires a minimum of **₹1,00,000** NTH.
*   However, some lenders maintain lower minimums, such as **L&T Finance** at **₹25,000** for several major metros, and **Finnable** setting the bar at **₹20,000** for Tier 1 cities.
*   **Aditya Birla Capital Ltd (ABCL)** generally requires a **₹20,000** salary for *all locations*. However, case data shows rejection in Chennai specifically due to salary being below **₹25,000**, suggesting an implicit higher regional threshold.

### 2. Tier 2 Cities (Intermediate Requirement Zones)

This grouping includes cities often classified as 'Growth' markets by Bajaj Finserv or other major Tier 1 cities not explicitly listed in the highest slab of L&T's policy, and Tier 2 cities listed by Finnable.

| Lender / Location Classification | Minimum Net Monthly Salary (NTH) | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bajaj Finserv (Growth Locations)** | **₹35,000** |
| **L&T Finance (Tier 1 Cities)** | **₹25,000** (Age < 35, Super CAT A, CAT B) / **₹30,000** (Age < 35, CAT C, CAT D) |
| **Axis Finance (Urban - CAT A, B)** | **₹35,000** (Revised Norm) |
| **Axis Finance (Urban - CAT C)** | **₹25,000** (Revised Norm) |
| **Finnable (Tier 2 Cities)** | **₹15,000** (Coimbatore, Tirupur, Trichy, Madurai, Hosur, Vellore, Kanchipuram, Pondicherry, Villupuram, Salem) |

**Key Insights for Tier 2:**

*   Bajaj Finserv sets the minimum NTH for its **Growth location** at **₹35,000**.
*   For co-applicants in BFL Annex & G2/G3/G4 locations, the minimum salary for the co-applicant is **₹15,000**.
*   L&T's requirements for Tier 1 cities (which often equate to other large cities not in the Metro list) fall mainly between **₹25,000 and ₹35,000**.
*   Finnable has a notably lower threshold of **₹15,000** for a list of specific Tier 2 cities in Tamil Nadu.

### 3. Tier 3 Cities and Smaller Towns (Lowest Requirement Zones)

This includes locations referred to as 'Tier 2,' 'Tier 3+,' 'Semi-Urban,' or 'Rural' markets.

| Lender / Location Classification | Minimum Net Monthly Salary (NTH) | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Aditya Birla Capital Ltd** | **₹20,000** (Across all locations) |
| **IDFC First Bank** | **₹20,000** (Mandatory for all Listed companies) |
| **L&T Finance (Tier 3+ Cities)** | **₹20,000** (Age < 35) / **₹25,000** (Age > 35) |
| **Axis Finance (Semi-Urban/Rural - CAT A, B, C, D)** | **₹20,000** |
| **MAS Financial Services** | **₹18,000** (General requirement) |
| **Werize** | **₹12,000** (Minimum salary criteria) |

**Key Insights for Tier 3/Rural:**

*   Several lenders adopt a floor of **₹20,000** for their lowest tier categories (e.g., L&T Tier 3+, Axis Finance Semi-Urban/Rural, ABCL All Locations, IDFC Listed Companies).
*   MAS Financial Services requires a minimum salary of **₹18,000**.
*   **Werize** has the lowest stated minimum salary criterion, starting at **₹12,000**.

### Summary of Minimum Salary Ranges by City Tier

The requirement is highly dynamic based on the risk appetite of the lender and the classification of the employment category (e.g., Cat A vs. Cat D).

| City Tier Classification | Typical Minimum NTH Range (INR) | Primary Lenders Representing this Range |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tier 1 (Metro/Prime)** | **₹30,000 – ₹50,000** (Up to ₹1,00,000 for high-risk profiles) | Bajaj Finserv, Axis Finance, Poonawalla, HDFC |
| **Tier 2 (Growth/Urban)** | **₹25,000 – ₹35,000** (Lower end starting at ₹15,000 for specific companies/locations) | Bajaj Finserv, L&T Finance, Axis Finance |
| **Tier 3 (Smaller Cities/Rural)** | **₹18,000 – ₹25,000** (Lowest floor at ₹12,000) | ABCL, MAS Finance, L&T Finance, Werize |

For instance, an applicant in a **Prime** Bajaj Finserv location needs **₹50,000**, while a similar applicant in a **Tier 1** city accessing a product through **Finnable** only requires **₹20,000**.

These salary floors act like a filter for loan applications: the higher the tier (Metro), the higher the assumed cost of living and, consequently, the expected minimum income required by the lending institution, similar to how a traffic signal has higher speed limits on a major highway (Metro) compared to a neighborhood road (Tier 3).



The interest rate (ROI) offered to an applicant is highly variable, depending not just on the CIBIL score bracket but also on factors like the loan amount (LA), the applicant's income band, the risk category assigned by the specific lender (e.g., Low-Risk/Green vs. High-Risk/Red), and the customer profile (e.g., Elite/Superprime vs. Open Market).

The following table synthesizes representative minimum/starting interest rates across the required CIBIL score brackets, primarily drawing on the detailed ROI grids provided by **ICICI Bank** and **L&T Finance**, and specialized rates for **New to Credit (NTC)** customers.

```json
"interest_rate_by_cibil": {
  "750_plus": 10.75,
  "725_749": 12.00,
  "700_724": 14.50,
  "675_699": 16.00,
  "ntc": 19.99
}
```

***

## Detailed Breakdown of CIBIL Score and Interest Rate Mapping

Interest rates typically start at the lowest end for the highest CIBIL scores and escalate sharply as the score decreases or the applicant falls into a higher internal risk segment.

### 1. CIBIL Score 750+

This bracket represents high credit quality and attracts the lowest interest rates, often starting around 10.50% to 11.50% for premier customers and large loan amounts.

| CIBIL Band | Lender / Segment | Example ROI (%) | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **>= 770** | ICICI (LA >= 20 Lakhs, Low-Risk) | **10.60%** | |
| **750 to 769** | ICICI (LA >= 20 Lakhs, Low-Risk) | **10.80%** | |
| **750+** | Bandhan Bank (Starts from) | **10.50%** | |
| **750+** | L&T (2L+ Income, 15L-30L LA, Super CAT A) | **11.5%** | |

**Key Insight:** The absolute lowest rates, such as 10.50% (Bandhan Bank starting rate) or 10.55% (ICICI Group/Infosys Group), are reserved for top-tier segments and large loan amounts (LA >= 20 Lakhs). For smaller loans (5L to 9.99L) in the Open Market segment, the minimum ROI for this score range starts around **11.95%**.

### 2. CIBIL Score 725–749

This range generally falls below the **"Super Prime"** threshold (often 750 or 770) but is still considered "Good." Lenders like L&T classify this within their **CIBIL 700-750** bracket.

| CIBIL Band | Lender / Segment | Example ROI (%) | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **< 750** | ICICI (Superprime, 5L-9.99L LA, Low Risk) | **11.80%** | |
| **700 – 750** | L&T (2L+ Income, 15L-30L LA, Super CAT A) | **12.5%** | |
| **< 750** | ICICI (Open Market, 5L-9.99L LA, Low Risk) | **12.30%** | |

**Key Insight:** For high-value profiles (Superprime), the rate might start as low as **11.80%**. However, for average customers (Open Market) taking moderate loans, rates typically start above 12% and quickly rise toward 14% or more, depending on the internal risk segment (Green, Amber, Red).

### 3. CIBIL Score 700–724

This range is often the lower limit of acceptability for many prime lenders. **L&T Finance** requires a minimum CIBIL score of **700** for high-tier categories (Super CAT A, CAT A, CAT B, CAT GB).

| CIBIL Band | Lender / Segment | Example ROI (%) | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **700 – 750** | L&T (50K-1L Income, 5L-7L LA, Cat C) | **15.5%** | |
| **700 – 750** | L&T (30K-50K Income, 50K-4.99L LA, Cat D, E) | **18.5%** | |
| **< 750** | ICICI (Low LA <50K, High Risk) | **16.50%** | |

**Key Insight:** Rates here are substantially higher than those for 750+. For lower income bands or lower company categories (like Cat C, D, E), rates can range from 15.5% up to **18.5%** in the L&T matrix. The median starting rate for a reasonable loan size tends to fall in the 13–15% range.

### 4. CIBIL Score 675–699

This bracket is considered high risk and is often the **minimum cut-off** for non-prime lenders or only accepted under restrictive conditions by prime lenders.

*   **Bajaj Finserv** generally requires a CIBIL Score of **>=685**. Scores below 685 are only allowed if the salary is above ₹2 Lakh in Prime/Annex locations.
*   **Muthoot Finance** accepts a minimum CIBIL score of **675** for Cat A & Cat B employees.
*   **L&T Finance** requires a minimum score of **700** for most categories, and **730** for Cat C & Cat D, meaning scores in the 675-699 range are generally rejected or face extremely high pricing.
*   **Bandhan Bank** states that rates range up to **16.99% max** for all types of customers.

**Key Insight:** Since this band is at the very limit of eligibility, the interest rate will be high. Rates will likely be priced near the maximum allowed range by the lender, hovering around **16.00% to 18.00%**.

### 5. NTC (New to Credit: 0 or -1)

New to Credit (NTC) applicants (CIBIL Score 0 or -1) are seen as high risk but can be funded by specialized programs or lenders with specific conditions.

*   **Finnable** allows NTC (0/-1) for applicants aged 23 and above. Their interest rates start at **19.99%** and go up to **28.99%** for personal loans.
*   **MAS Financial Services** allows a CIBIL score of **-1** with a maximum loan amount of ₹2 Lakh. Their rates range from **18% to 31%**.
*   **Bandhan Bank** allows 0/-1 CIBIL scores for funding up to ₹5 Lakhs for high-grade Government employees/Cat A, and up to ₹3 Lakhs for other categories, with maximum rates capped at **16.99%**.
*   **Kotak Mahindra Bank** allows fresh loans up to ₹10 Lakh for Cat AA, A, B, C & Govt. with CIBIL 0/-1, subject to conditions.

**Key Insight:** NTC customers face significantly higher rates due to the absence of credit history. The starting rate of **19.99%** from Finnable is a solid representation of the floor for high-risk, unproven credit profiles.

***

**Analogy:** Determining interest rates based on CIBIL scores is similar to setting insurance premiums based on a driver's safety record. A driver with a flawless record (CIBIL 750+) gets the best premium (lowest ROI). A driver with a couple of minor speeding tickets (CIBIL 700-724) pays a significantly higher premium (higher ROI). A brand-new driver with no history (NTC) pays a high default premium (highest ROI) because the risk is unknown and potentially catastrophic, even though they haven't had an accident yet.







The maximum loan amount (Max LA) offered is not fixed across the board but is strictly determined by the lender's policies, varying significantly based on the applicant’s profile (customer segment, company category, and internal risk rating) and their geographic location.

The absolute highest loan caps observed across the sources reach **₹50 Lakhs**, reserved for elite customers in prime locations.

### Maximum Loan Cap Estimate

Based on the highest thresholds observed for premium segments and general limits for standard segments:

```json
"max_loan_cap": {
  "standard": 2500000,
  "prime": 5000000
}
```

***

## Detailed Analysis of Maximum Loan Amount Caps

The sources confirm that the maximum achievable loan amount is highly segmented, often falling into specific tiers based on risk and company rating.

### 1. Prime/Elite Customer Caps (₹35 Lakhs to ₹50 Lakhs)

The absolute highest loan amounts are reserved for Super Category A employees, highly rated Government employees (Ratna/Central PSU), and those applying in Prime metro locations with low-risk profiles.

| Lender | Maximum Cap | Segment/Condition | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Aditya Birla Capital Ltd** | **₹50,00,000** | General upper limit for Term loan. | |
| **Poonawalla Fincorp** | **₹50,00,000** | Max tier cap for Super A & Govt Ratna in Metro location. | |
| **Bajaj Finserv (BFL)** | **₹50,00,000** | Reserved for Prime locations (Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Pune, Hyderabad, Chennai, Kolkata, Ahmedabad) meeting specific criteria (Diamond, Platinum, Gold, Silver, Blue, Bronze, Pvt Ltd Company, Age <50). | |
| **Bandhan Bank** | **₹40,00,000** | Maximum loan amount for Doctors. | |
| **BFL (Super Green)** | **₹38,00,000** | Max cap in Prime, G1, and G2 locations for Super Green/Green risk segments. Also the max LA for BFL employees in the highest band (GB 07 A & Above). | |
| **TATA Capital** | **₹35,00,000** | Max loan amount for TGE, SCAT-A, CAT-A & Government employees. | |
| **BFL (State Govt, PSU)** | **₹35,00,000** | Max LA for PSU and Central Government employees/entities in the Super Segment. | |

### 2. Standard/Mid-Risk Customer Caps (₹25 Lakhs to ₹30 Lakhs)

This range represents the typical high-value loan offered to good-to-excellent CIBIL score customers who do not meet the "Super Elite" criteria or reside in Annex/Tier 2 locations.

| Lender | Maximum Cap | Segment/Condition | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **L&T Finance** | **₹30,00,000** | General maximum loan amount. | |
| **Poonawalla Fincorp** | **₹30,00,000** | Max tier cap for CAT C in Tier 2 cities. High-Risk segment maximum loan amount is restricted to ₹30 Lakhs. | |
| **Bandhan Bank** | **₹25,00,000** | General maximum loan amount. | |
| **Piramal Finance** | **₹25,00,000** | General ticket size maximum. | |
| **TATA Capital** | **₹25,00,000** | Max loan amount for CAT-B and CAT-C categories. | |
| **BFL (State Govt)** | **₹25,00,000** | Max LA for State Govt employee in the Super Segment. | |
| **Muthoot Finance** | **₹20,00,000** | Max loan amount for Cat A, Cat B, and Government employees. | |

### 3. Lower/Specialized Customer Caps (₹2 Lakhs to ₹10 Lakhs)

Specific risk profiles, non-preferred entities, or low-income segments face hard caps that override calculations based on salary multiplier:

*   **Low Salary:** Bajaj Finserv restricts the maximum loan amount to **₹20 Lakhs** for customers with a salary $\le$ ₹1.10 Lakh, regardless of higher calculated eligibility.
*   **High Risk/NTC:**
    *   L&T Finance caps CIBIL -1 (NTC segment) maximum loan amount at **₹10 Lakhs** for Super Cat A & Cat A, and **₹5 Lakhs** for other company categories.
    *   Kotak Mahindra Bank offers fresh loans up to **₹10 Lakhs** for CIBIL 0/-1 customers in categories AA, A, B, C & Govt..
    *   Poonawalla Fincorp caps NTC (0/-1) or CAT D at **₹10 Lakhs**.
    *   MAS Financial Services caps CIBIL -1 loan amount at **₹2 Lakhs**.
*   **Unlisted/Non-Corporate Entities:**
    *   Aditya Birla caps funding for Proprietorship, LLP, and Partnership firms employees at **₹5 Lakhs**.
    *   Kotak Mahindra Bank caps Unlisted Companies funding at Max **₹10 Lakhs**.
    *   Piramal does Grade 4 & Partnership firms profiles up to **₹10 Lakhs**.
*   **Non-Preferred Products/Segments:** InCred's Self Employed Non-Professional Policy caps loan amounts at **₹7.5 Lakhs** (general) and **₹3 Lakhs** (ITR segment).

### Conclusion on Loan Caps

The data overwhelmingly confirms that the maximum loan amount is capped based on risk segmentation, often superseding multiplier calculations:

1.  **Prime Cap:** The aspirational maximum loan cap for the most creditworthy profiles (Prime, Super Green, Govt. Ratna) is **₹50,00,000**.
2.  **Standard Cap:** A common high-end ceiling for financially stable, mid-to-high-income customers across most major institutions is generally **₹25,00,000 to ₹30,00,000**.
3.  **Risk Cap:** Customers with credit defects, limited credit history (NTC), or working in non-listed/non-preferred companies often see their caps severely restricted, frequently falling into the **₹5 Lakhs to ₹10 Lakhs** bracket.

This variability ensures that while the highest-quality applicants can access the largest loans, overall portfolio risk is managed by imposing hard ceilings on less predictable customer segments, acting like a safety valve that limits the exposure for applications presenting even minor risk flags.




This section details the professions, roles, and industries explicitly listed as negative or excluded profiles by lenders, drawing primarily from the comprehensive policy annexures of Bajaj Finserv (BFL) and Poonawalla Fincorp.

The sources do not explicitly mention the exclusion of **Alcohol**, **Tobacco**, or **Cryptocurrency** industries, but they do exclude other high-risk or unregulated sectors.

]
```

***

## Detailed Breakdown of Exclusions

### A. Excluded Professions and Roles (Negative Profiles)

Lenders define certain job designations and employment types as "Negative Profiles," leading to automatic rejection regardless of salary or CIBIL score.

| Excluded Profession/Role | Supporting Detail | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Police and Related Enforcement** | **Police** and other related enforcement organizations (BRDO, BRO, BSF, CRPF, RPF, etc.) are **not allowed in any program**. Poonawalla Fincorp also excludes **Police profiles**. | |
| **Legal Professionals** | **Judge/Lawyers** are **not allowed in any program** (BFL). Poonawalla Fincorp also specifically lists **Lawyers** as a negative profile. | |
| **Political Persons** | **Politically connected individuals** are **not allowed in any program** (BFL). Poonawalla Fincorp excludes **Politically Exposed Persons**. | |
| **Sales/Agency Professionals** | **DSA / Collection Agency / Verification Agency** are **not allowed in any program** (BFL). Poonawalla Fincorp lists **DSA and Collection Agents** as negative profiles. | |
| **Commission-Based Workers** | The job role being **commission-based** led to rejection in a customer case (Senthil Kumar). Piramal Finance specifies that **LIC Agents** are eligible *only if fixed salary*, not on a commission basis. | |
| **Blue Collar/Support Staff** | These are categorized broadly as **Class IV employees** or **Blue collar profiles**. Specific examples of excluded roles include: **Drivers**, **Sweepers**, **Peons**, **Watchman**, **Office boy**, **Lift Operator**, **MTS (Multi-tasking Staff)**, **Chaprasi**, **Mali**, and **Security guards**. L&T Finance states that **Group D** government employees are **not allowed**. | |
| **Defence/Military** | **Defence profiles** are **not allowed to source in Prime market** by BFL. Poonawalla Fincorp excludes Defence profiles that do not fulfill specific criteria. Government **Railway Employees** are also excluded by BFL in the SAL GOV program. | |
| **Government/PSU Specific** | **Government School Teachers** are **not allowed in all locations of West Bengal** (BFL). **Coal Field employees** are restricted or not allowed to source. BFL also restricts sourcing from **Govt Hospitals** in Delhi & its Annex locations. | |
| **High-Risk Employment** | Employees serving **notice period, PIP, DAC,** or **Pre-PIP** are excluded from BFL Employee Loan Policy. | |

### B. Excluded Industries and Entities

Excluded industries typically involve high-risk, unregulated, or politically sensitive activities, or non-corporate structures.

| Excluded Industry/Sector | Supporting Detail | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gambling/High-Risk Finance** | **Internet gambling**, **chit fund**, **Nidhi**, and **lottery** are **not allowed in any program** (BFL). **Online Gaming** is also explicitly excluded. | |
| **Unlisted/Specific Financial Services** | **Unlisted NBFC’s** are **not allowed**. **Small NBFC** and **Stock broking** are **not allowed** (BFL DOE 2). Non-Indian Bank Backed **Stock Broking/Securities companies** are generally excluded. | |
| **Service and Outsourcing** | **Listed and Unlisted Manpower Outsourcing/ Recruitment/ Staffing companies** are **not allowed to source in any program**. **Manpower companies** are broadly excluded. **SPA / Beauty Parlours & Saloon** are **not allowed**. | |
| **Manufacturing/Commodities** | **Mines** are **not allowed**. **Jewellers** (Gold/ Diamond related business) are **not allowed**. | |
| **Media/Marketing** | **Multi-level marketing companies** are **not allowed**. **Media Companies** like Zee news, Star India Ltd, DD News, DD Sports, etc., are **not allowed**. | |
| **Unregistered/Non-Corporate** | Employees of **Proprietorships, Partnerships, HUF, Trusts and co-operative societies** are generally **not to be funded** by BFL. L&T Finance specifically prohibits sourcing from **Partnership or proprietorship firm employees**. InCred's Self Employed policy restricts applications only to **Proprietor** profiles, excluding Partnerships and Private Ltd. Companies. | |

### C. Other Exclusions (Non-Industry Specific)

BFL excludes certain transactional or physical environments:
*   Customers staying in **PG, Hostel & guest house**.
*   **Work from Home profile** (generally, unless specific compliance checks are met).
*   **Office premises as Co-working space** (unless specific verification norms are met).
*   **Negative area/OGL** (Negative geographical limits).
*   **Foreign National/Non Residential Indian**.

---
**Analogy:** The list of negative profiles acts like an internal firewall for a bank, filtering out known security risks (like individuals in high-leverage roles like police or lawyers) and sectors prone to volatility or fraud (like gaming, MLMs, and unregulated financial entities) before their applications even reach the main risk assessment engine.





## Category 5: Salary Credit Modes Accepted

Lender policies predominantly mandate that salary be credited electronically via bank transfer modes (NEFT/RTGS/IMPS) and generally **reject** cash or cheque credits, as non-electronic modes introduce a higher risk of fraud and difficulty in verification. However, certain digital transfers like IMPS/UPI require specific checks.

### Estimated Output

```json
"salary_modes_allowed": [
  "Bank Transfer (NEFT/RTGS)",
  "IMPS/UPI (Conditional)",
  "Cheque (Rejected)",
  "Cash (Rejected)"
]
```

***

## Detailed Analysis of Accepted Salary Credit Modes

### 1. Bank Transfer (NEFT/RTGS)

Direct, automated bank transfers (NEFT/RTGS) are the standard and most secure methods required by virtually all lenders for salary credit verification. The core requirement for Bajaj Finserv (BFL) is that salary credits in the bank statement should be **only through direct mode**.

### 2. IMPS/UPI (Conditional Acceptance)

IMPS, UPI, and other instant transfer methods are often viewed with suspicion unless specific criteria are met, as these modes can sometimes mask peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers rather than employer-to-employee salary disbursements.

*   **BFL (Suspicious Transactions):** Salary transactions with **IMPS, P2P, N2P, P2A, TPT** or any other anomaly are considered suspicious. In such cases, a Risk Assessment (RSA) needs to be raised.
*   **Werize (Conditional IMPS):** Werize accepts salary mode as **Bank transfer (NEFT/RTGS/IMPS)**, but specifically notes that if the customer uses **IMPS mode, it should be a PVT LTD company** and **PF deduction should be there**.
*   **Poonawalla Fincorp:** While not directly mentioning IMPS/UPI, Poonawalla requires the latest **3 months’ Salary Credit in the Bank to be considered for assessment purpose**.

### 3. Cash and Cheque Credits (Generally Rejected)

Lenders explicitly reject or severely penalize salaries credited via cash or personal/cheque transactions, as these are non-traceable and cannot confirm the source of the income as being the stated employer.

*   **BFL (Explicit Rejection):** BFL explicitly states that **salary credits in the bank statement should be only through direct mode and not cash/cheque**.
*   **Poonawalla Fincorp (Cash Exclusion):** Poonawalla Fincorp's norms for CAT E (unlisted/non-corporate entities) state that **Cash Salary** is **not allowed**.
*   **Chola (Implicit Rejection):** Chola requires minimum **6 months banking**, and salary credit must be **reflected continuously**. Given the policy structure of major lenders, continuous cash or cheque credits would typically fail the required 'direct mode' verification.

### Summary of Verification Requirements

For electronic credits to be accepted, lenders impose strict verification checks:

1.  **Direct Credit:** Salary must be credited directly from the employer's account (Direct Mode).
2.  **Regular Dates:** All months must show salary credits on regular dates, with a span of 5 working days allowed for fluctuation. For non-government employees, salary delay is allowed only up to 5 days, and for government employees, up to 30 days.
3.  **Narration Check:** The salary credit narration should ideally contain the **‘Company name’** and **‘Salary’** keywords. Underwriters must check for salary credit, date, and employment if the company name or salary is missing.
4.  **Verification Tool Use:** High-risk transfer modes (like IMPS) must be verified, often using automated tools like **Perfios/OCR/Account Aggregator**. BFL specifies that covert verification is not allowed for bank employee salary accounts due to staff account restrictions, requiring **Perfios Banking & Official email confirmation mandatory**.




The eligibility criteria for personal loans place high importance on demonstrating employment stability, usually defined by minimum tenure in the current organization and total career experience.

Based on the information available across various lending programs, the standard requirements are synthesized as follows:

```json
"work_experience": {
  "min_months_current_job": 6,
  "min_total_experience_months": 24,
  "employment_gaps_allowed": false
}
```

The requirements vary significantly based on the risk profile and the program type offered by the lender.

### 1. Minimum Months in Current Job

While some policies are highly lenient for specific programs, the overall requirement tends to cluster between 6 months and 1 year for standard customers.

| Lender / Program | Minimum Current Employment | Condition / Nuance | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bajaj Finserv (FUW)** | **$ \ge 1 \text{ day}$** | Allowed if current employment is less than 1 month, provided the applicant furnishes a CTC letter, email confirmation, and **6 months of banking from the previous employer**. |
| **Poonawalla Fincorp** | **1 month** | Required for CAT A / Super CAT A employees. |
| **Poonawalla Fincorp** | **3 months** | Required for CAT E employees (6 months required, 3 months allowed with deviation). |
| **Finnable** | **3 months** | Minimum 3 months salary credit required in the current company. |
| **TATA Capital** | **12 months** (1 year) | Minimum Current Employment Stability required for most profiles. |
| **BFL (DOE 3 - Low/Medium Risk)** | **6 months** | Required for customers falling under the DOE 3 Salary Norms policy. |
| **BFL (Unlisted Co. - ABB Program)** | **6 months** | Required for employees of unlisted companies under the Average Bank Balance (ABB) program. |
| **Werize** | **9 months** | Werize requires 1 year of banking with a minimum of 9 months of salary credit. |

**Standard Conclusion on Current Job Tenure:** Although some lenders permit a start date of 1 day for top-tier employees (if total experience is proven), the general minimum floor for stable, risk-managed applications is usually **6 months**.

### 2. Minimum Total Work Experience

The consistent requirement for most prime and mid-tier loan programs is two years of total experience.

| Lender / Program | Minimum Total Experience | Condition / Nuance | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bajaj Finserv (FUW & MTS)** | **$ \ge 3 \text{ years}$** (36 months) | Total Employment experience must be $\ge$ 3 years. This norm is waived for applicants aged $\ge$ 23 to $<25$ years. |
| **Poonawalla Fincorp** | **12 months** (1 year) | Required for CAT A / Super CAT A employees. |
| **Poonawalla Fincorp** | **24 months** (2 years) | Required for Other categories (CAT B, C, D, E). |
| **TATA Capital** | **24 months** (2 years) | Minimum Total Employment Stability required. (Waivers apply for customers with high CIBIL/income/LA). |
| **Bandhan Bank** | **1 year** | 1 year total job stability required for salaried individuals. |
| **InCred (Self Employed)** | **24 months** (2 years) | Minimum Business Vintage required for self-employed non-professionals based on GST proof. |
| **Chola** | **1 year** | Minimum 1 year total experience for all categories (CAT A, B, C, D). |

**Standard Conclusion on Total Experience:** While highly preferred applicants (CAT A) may require only 1 year, the benchmark for most robust programs (BFL, Tata, Poonawalla standard categories) is **24 months (2 years)**.

### 3. Continuous Employment or Gaps Allowed

Lenders prioritize demonstrating that the applicant has consistently earned income throughout their career, though short gaps are managed through documentation requirements.

*   **Preference for Continuity:** The strict tracking of **Total Employment experience** and the reliance on continuous salary credits strongly imply a preference for continuity.
*   **Managing Short Gaps (Job Change):** If a customer has **Current employment less than 1 month**, BFL requires **6 months banking of the previous employer** to be documented and validated. This mechanism allows applicants to switch jobs and immediately apply, essentially covering the employment gap by proving income stability in the prior role.
*   **Bandhan Bank** requires 1 year total job stability, and if the applicant joined the current company only 1 month ago, they must provide **previous employment proof to validate total 1 year stability**.
*   **Rejection due to Short Tenure:** Customer C. Anitha was rejected by InCred and Werize because "Minimum 8 months salary is must but customer doesn’t fulfill the criteria". This indicates that proving income history and job stability over several months is non-negotiable for many programs, even for applicants with high CIBIL scores.

**Conclusion on Gaps:** While long, unexplained gaps are detrimental, **short gaps between jobs are mitigated** by documenting salary history from the previous employer, provided the total required work experience (typically 2-3 years) is met. Thus, the system is designed to favor **continuous stability proof** rather than explicitly allowing career gaps.




The funding of New-to-Credit (NTC) applicants (CIBIL score 0 or -1, also referred to as "Bureau No-Hit") is governed by highly restrictive, specialized programs designed to mitigate the inherent risk of having no credit history. The conditions often include strict age limits, higher effective minimum salaries, mandatory digital verification, and significantly capped loan amounts.

### Estimated Output for NTC Special Conditions

Based on a comprehensive review of specialized NTC programs offered by lenders like Bajaj Finserv (BFL), Finnable, and Muthoot Finance:

```json
"ntc_conditions": {
  "min_age_ntc": 23,
  "min_salary_ntc": 20000,
  "bank_statement_months": 6
}
```

***

## Detailed Breakdown of New-to-Credit (NTC) Conditions

### 1. Minimum Age for NTC Customers

Lenders impose an explicit higher minimum age for NTC customers compared to standard applicants, signaling a requirement for established career stability.

*   **Bajaj Finserv (BFL) Bureau No-Hit Program:** The minimum age for application is **23 years**. The maximum age is capped sharply at **35 years** at the time of loan application. This age restriction also applies to government employees seeking loans under the SAL GOV program with Bureau No-hit.
*   **Finnable:** Requires the NTC (0, -1) customer to be **age above 23**.
*   **Muthoot Finance:** Allows CIBIL -1 cases for applicants aged **23-30** years.
*   **Kotak Mahindra Bank:** Allows CIBIL 0/-1 funding; the general minimum age is 21 years.

The consistent requirement from specialized programs places the minimum NTC age at **23 years**.

### 2. Minimum Salary Requirements for NTC

While some lenders maintain their standard minimum salary, others are forced to accept lower floors, particularly in Tier 2 markets, but generally, NTC funding is only allowed for employees in stable company categories.

*   **Bajaj Finserv (BFL):** The Minimum Net Salary for NTC cases is **as per existing SALPL norms**. For Prime/Annex locations, this is **₹50,000**, and for Growth locations, it is **₹35,000**.
*   **Poonawalla Fincorp:** The general minimum net take-home salary is **₹30,000**.
*   **Aditya Birla Capital Ltd (ABCL):** NTC customers are eligible for login, provided they meet the overall minimum salary requirement of **₹20,000** required across all locations.
*   **Finnable:** Requires a net salary of **₹20,000** in Tier 1 locations (Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Delhi, Mumbai, Pune) and **₹15,000** in Tier 2 cities.
*   **MAS Financial Services:** The general minimum salary required is **₹18,000**.

The strict eligibility requirements often mean that low-income NTC customers are rejected, as demonstrated by the rejection of Dinesh Kumar (salary ₹15,375) by Aditya Birla due to score norms, likely compounded by his CIBIL score of -1.

### 3. Document and Stability Requirements for NTC

NTC customers face heightened scrutiny regarding their income proof and banking stability, often requiring mandatory digital verification tools.

| Condition | Requirement/Duration | Lender | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Banking Verification** | **Mandatory Account Aggregator/Perfios/OCR** | BFL Bureau No-Hit Program | |
| **Salary Credit History** | Minimum **3 months** banking required, with 3 months salary credits checked | BFL Bureau No-Hit Program | |
| **Payslip Requirement** | **3 months' payslip** must be documented | BFL Bureau No-Hit Program | |
| **Bureau Vintage** | Minimum bureau vintage should be **6 months** (for NTC 0/-1 in non-metro/Tier 1/2) | Poonawalla Fincorp | |
| **Mobile/Identity Check** | EPAN is mandatory, and **Mobile verification from Karza is mandatory** (mobile must be min 6 months old in Karza) | BFL Bureau No-Hit Program (Govt Employees) | |
| **Geo-Tagging** | **Geo tagging is mandatory** in the BFL Bureau No-Hit program. | |

### 4. NTC Maximum Loan Amount Caps

The most critical special condition for NTC customers is the severely limited maximum loan amount, regardless of high salary, due to the unproven credit risk.

*   **L&T Finance:** Caps NTC (CIBIL -1) loan amount at Max **₹10 Lakhs** for Super Cat A & Cat A employees, and Max **₹5 Lakhs** for other company categories.
*   **Bajaj Finserv (BFL):** Caps the maximum loan amount under the Bureau No-Hit Program at **₹10 Lakhs**.
*   **Bandhan Bank:** Funds up to **₹5 Lakhs** for Govt Grade I & II and CAT A, and up to **₹3 Lakhs** for other Categories.
*   **Poonawalla Fincorp:** Maximum loan amount for CAT D or New to Credit (NTC/0/-1) is **₹10 Lakhs**.
*   **Muthoot Finance:** Maximum loan amount is restricted to **₹1.5 Lakhs** for CIBIL -1 applicants.
*   **MAS Financial Services:** Maximum loan amount is **₹2 Lakh** for CIBIL -1 customers.
*   **Kotak Mahindra Bank:** Allows a fresh loan up to **₹10 Lakhs** for top categories (CAT AA, A, B, C & Govt.).

The maximum loan amount restriction serves as the primary risk control mechanism, compensating for the lack of credit history by limiting the lender's exposure.

***
**Analogy:** Approving a loan for an NTC customer is like issuing a driver’s license to someone who has only ever used a simulator. The lender assumes they have the skills (salary/job stability) but must impose severe initial restrictions, such as a low speed limit (low loan cap), mandated vehicle tracking (Perfios/AA), and a minimum established age (23 years), until real-world performance (credit history) is generated.



## Category 8: Loan Tenure Variations

Loan tenure options show significant variation, primarily driven by the maximum age of the applicant at maturity, the customer's risk segment/salary, and the specific loan product type (Term Loan vs. Flexi Loan).

### Estimated Output

```json
"tenure_options": {
  "min_months": 12,
  "max_months_standard_term_loan": 72,
  "max_months_premium_flexi": 96
}
```

***

## Detailed Breakdown of Loan Tenure Requirements

### 1. Minimum and Maximum Standard Tenure

The standard minimum tenure across most lenders is 12 months, while the maximum general tenure typically falls between 60 and 72 months for salaried individuals.

| Parameter | Tenure (Months) | Supporting Lender / Program | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Minimum Tenure** | **12 Months** | Aditya Birla Capital Ltd (Term loan), Bajaj Finserv (Term Loan/Flexi), Poonawalla Fincorp | |
| **Standard Maximum (Salaried)** | **72 Months** | Bandhan Bank (for salaried), L&T Finance, Piramal Finance, TATA Capital (for Salary >30K) | |
| **Extended Maximum (Premium/Flexi)** | **84 Months** | Aditya Birla Capital Ltd (Term loan), Axis Finance (Super Edge/PL Shift Plus), IDFC First Bank (with NTH 50K/35K) | |
| **Absolute Maximum (Flexi Products)** | **96 Months** | Bajaj Finserv (Term Loan/Dropline Flexi), Aditya Birla Capital Ltd (OD cases only) | |

### 2. Tenure Variation by Customer Age

Age is the most critical factor determining the maximum tenure, as the loan must mature before the customer reaches the maximum stipulated age (typically 59, 60, or 62 for Government employees).

*   **Maximum Age at Maturity:**
    *   **Bajaj Finserv (BFL):** Maximum age is **59 years** at the time of loan maturity.
    *   **Poonawalla Fincorp:** Maximum age is **60 years** at the time of loan maturity.
    *   **Muthoot Finance:** Maximum age is **60 years** (with end of loan tenure).
    *   **Government Employees (BFL):** With retirement proof, max age is **62 years** at the time of loan maturity. For professors, age up to **65 years** is allowed at maturity for Govt & University employees.
    *   **Age Over 55 (BFL):** If the age is **> 55 years**, the tenure of the loan must be adjusted so that the loan expires at **59 years**. Only Term Loan/Drop Line Flexi is allowed for those above 55 years.

### 3. Tenure Variation by Customer Segment and Salary

Tenure is often restricted based on the applicant's salary and risk segment, particularly when accessing extended tenure options.

| Segment/Condition | Maximum Tenure (Months) | Lender / Policy | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **High Salary (BFL)** | **96 Months** | Available only for cases with salary **$\ge$ ₹50k** in Term Loan & Dropline Flexi. | |
| **Low Salary (BFL)** | **60 Months** | Cases with salary **< ₹50k** are capped at a maximum tenure of **60 months** in Term Loan/Dropline Flexi. | |
| **Government Segment (BFL)** | **84 Months** | Maximum tenure for Super Segment, CAT GA, and CAT GB Government employees in Term Loan/Dropline Flexi is **84 months**. CAT GO is capped at **60 months**. | |
| **CAT E (Poonawalla Fincorp)** | **36 Months** | The highest risk/lowest preference category (Cat E) is restricted to a maximum tenure of **36 months**. | |
| **New to Credit (BFL)** | **60/84 Months** | NTC cases (Bureau No-Hit Program) are capped at **60 months** for Term Loan/Dropline Flexi. Hybrid Flexi is allowed up to **84 months** only if LA > ₹5 Lakh. | |
| **Self Employed (InCred)** | **24 to 48 Months** | The Self Employed Non-Professional policy limits tenure from **24 Months to 48 Months**. | |

### 4. Tenure Variation by Loan Amount and Product Type

Longer tenures are often mandatory for larger loans or specific flexible products.

*   **Hybrid/Flexi Loans (BFL):** Hybrid Flexi can be **84 months or 96 months** total tenure. The eligibility calculation for these requires assessing eligibility based on a shorter underlying Dropline Flexi tenure (60 months for 84-month total; 72 months for 96-month total).
*   **Balance Transfer (BT):** For Paperless BT programs (BFL), the maximum tenure is **84 months** for Term Loan/Dropline Flexi, provided salary is $\ge$ ₹50k. Without checking the salary ($>$₹50k) through banking, the maximum tenure is only **72 months**.

In essence, loan tenure acts as a lever for risk: for older or lower-salaried customers, the maximum tenure is reduced to limit exposure, while younger, higher-income clients in low-risk segments are granted access to the longest available tenures (96 months) through premium loan variants.




Based on the detailed policies from various financial institutions, loan tenure is highly structured and varies significantly based on the maximum age of the applicant, their salary bracket, risk segmentation, and the type of loan product chosen (e.g., Term Loan vs. Flexi/OD).

### Loan Tenure Variation Summary

## Detailed Analysis of Loan Tenure Requirements

### 1. Minimum and Maximum Standard Tenure

The standard range for loan tenures is wide, but minimums are consistent, while maximums depend heavily on the lending institution and the product type.

| Tenure Parameter | Requirement (Months) | Supporting Details | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Minimum Tenure** | **12 Months** | This is the minimum tenor across most Bajaj Finserv (BFL) programs (Term Loan, Dropline Flexi, Hybrid Flexi), Aditya Birla Capital Ltd (ABCL) for Term Loans, and Poonawalla Fincorp. | |
| **Standard Maximum** | **60 Months** | Maximum tenure for salaried individuals at Bandhan Bank and for BFL cases where the salary is **less than ₹50k**. It is also the maximum tenure for the lowest risk segment (CAT GO) in the BFL SAL GOV program. TATA Capital also caps the maximum tenure for general segments at **60 months**. | |
| **Extended Maximum** | **72 Months** | Piramal Finance allows up to **72 Months**. L&T Finance sets its maximum tenure at **72 months**. TATA Capital provides 72 months for salaried customers with salary **$>$ ₹30k**. | |
| **Highest Maximum (Term Loan)** | **84 Months** | ABCL allows Term Loan tenure up to **84 months**. BFL allows **84 months** for Term Loan/Dropline Flexi in its Government Employee Program (Super Segment, CAT GA, CAT GB) and in the Paperless Balance Transfer program if salary is **$\ge$ ₹50k**. IDFC First Bank also offers 72M / **84M** tenure policies. | |
| **Absolute Maximum (Flexi/OD)**| **96 Months** | BFL offers Term Loan and Dropline Flexi options up to **96 months** for cases where salary is **$\ge$ ₹50k**. ABCL provides **96 months** only for Overdraft (OD) cases. | |

---

### 2. Tenure Variation by Age of Customer

The maximum age of the customer at the time of loan maturity is a primary determinant of the tenure offered.

*   **Standard Maturity Age:** The maximum age for loan maturity is generally **59 years** at BFL and **60 years** at Poonawalla Fincorp and Muthoot Finance.
*   **Age Restriction on Tenure:** If the applicant's age is **$>$ 55 years**, the loan tenure must be adjusted so that the loan **expires at 59 years**. Furthermore, only Term Loan or Drop Line Flexi is allowed for those aged over 55 years.
*   **Government/Professor Exception:** For Government employees, the maximum age at maturity can be extended up to **62 years** with retirement proof. For professors in Government and University settings, the maximum age is allowed up to **65 years** at the time of loan maturity.
*   **Young Applicants:** Young applicants aged $\ge 23$ to $<25$ years face specific restrictions on CIBIL and salary, but the standard total employment experience requirement is waived for them.

---

### 3. Tenure Variation by Customer Segment and Salary

Tenure is directly influenced by the applicant's risk classification (segment) and their Net Take Home (NTH) salary.

| Segment/Salary Condition | Maximum Tenure | Impact/Lender | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **High Salary (BFL)** | **96 Months** | Available only for cases where the salary is **$\ge$ ₹50k** in Term Loan & Dropline Flexi. | |
| **Low Salary (BFL)** | **60 Months** | Cases with salary **$<$ ₹50k** are restricted to a maximum tenure of **60 months** in Term Loan/Dropline Flexi. | |
| **Highest Risk Segment (Poonawalla)** | **36 Months** | CAT E (highest risk segment) is capped at a maximum of **36 months**. | |
| **Government Employees (BFL)** | **84 Months** | Available for Super Segment, CAT GA, and CAT GB government employees in Term Loan/Dropline Flexi, but CAT GO is restricted to **60 months**. | |
| **Self-Employed (InCred)** | **24 to 48 Months** | The maximum tenure for the Self Employed Non-Professional segment is **48 Months**. | |
| **NTC/No Bureau Hit (BFL)** | **60 Months** | Term Loan and Dropline Flexi are capped at **60 months** for the Bureau No-Hit Program, though Hybrid Flexi is allowed up to 84 months if the loan amount (LA) is $> 5$ Lakh. | |

### 4. Tenure Variation by Loan Amount and Product Type

Specific loan variants, such as Hybrid or Flexi loans, utilize longer maximum tenures, which often require calculating eligibility based on a shorter underlying tenor.

*   **Hybrid/Flexi Loans:** BFL Hybrid Flexi tenure can be **84 months or 96 months** total. For Hybrid Flexi with 96 months total tenure, eligibility is calculated based on a dropline tenure of **72 months**. For 84 months total tenure, eligibility is calculated based on a dropline tenure of **60 months**.
*   **Extended Tenure Eligibility Check:** For Term Loans with a tenure **$\ge$ 72 months**, eligibility must be calculated using a **72-month tenure**.
*   **Maximum LA Criteria:** The extended maximum tenure of 84 months in the BFL Bureau No-Hit program is only available if the loan amount is **$>$ ₹5 Lakh**.




The processing fee (PF) structure for personal loans is highly stratified, typically based on a percentage of the loan amount (LA) or charged as a flat fixed fee, depending on the loan size and the customer's risk profile. The fees generally range from **1.00% to 2.5%**, with fixed amounts serving as defined floors and ceilings for specific premium segments.

### Processing Fee Details Estimate

Based on the fee structures detailed by lenders like ICICI Bank and Piramal Finance:

```json
"processing_fee_details": {
  "percentage": 1.5,
  "min_amount": 3999,
  "max_amount": 9999,
  "gst_included": false
}
```

***

## Detailed Breakdown of Processing Fee Structures

### 1. Processing Fee Percentage and Fixed Fees

Processing fees are calculated either as a straight percentage of the loan amount or as fixed charges, which are often tied to the customer segment and loan size.

| Parameter | Observed Range/Value | Lender / Program | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Percentage Range** | **1.00% to 2.5%** | Piramal Finance charges **1.5% to 2.5%**. ICICI Bank charges 1.50% of LA for loan amounts less than ₹5 Lakhs. | |
| **Minimum Fixed Fee** | **₹3,999** | For ICICI Group/Infosys Group, the fee is the lower of **₹3,999** or 1.00% of LA. | |
| **Maximum Fixed Fee** | **₹9,999** | For Superprime/Elite/Open Market customers seeking large loans (e.g., ₹15L to ₹19.99L), ICICI Bank charges fixed fees up to **₹9,999.00**. | |

### 2. Processing Fee Variation by Loan Amount and Risk

ICICI Bank's fee matrix demonstrates how processing fees (PF) are adjusted based on loan size (LA) and internal risk segmentation (Low-Risk/Medium-Risk/High-Risk):

| Loan Amount (LA) Band | CIBIL/Risk Segment | Processing Fee | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LA $\ge$ 20 Lakhs** | $\ge 770$, Low-Risk | ₹6,999.00 | |
| **LA $\ge$ 20 Lakhs** | $<750 / 0 / -1$, High-Risk | ₹8,999.00 | |
| **LA $\ge$ 5L to 9.99L** | Open Market, All Risk | Fixed fees from ₹7,999.00 to ₹8,999.00 | |
| **LA $\ge$ 50K to 99.99K** | All Segments | 1.50% of LA | |
| **LA $<$ 50K** | All Segments | 1.50% of LA | |

For the lowest loan amounts (e.g., less than ₹5 Lakhs), the fee is calculated as a percentage (**1.50% of LA**), ensuring the fee remains proportionate to the disbursed amount. For larger loans to premium segments, fixed fees (e.g., ₹8,999) are applied.

### 3. GST Inclusion

The sources indicate that GST (Goods and Services Tax) is typically charged **extra** (not included) in the quoted fee structure.

While the ICICI tables list specific PF amounts (e.g., ₹8,999.00) without explicit mention of GST inclusion, Poonawalla Fincorp provides clarity on charging statutory taxes for related loan charges. Poonawalla specifies that foreclosure and partial repayment charges, if not paid from own funds, are **4% + GST**. This explicit addition of GST to a financial charge suggests that fixed fees and percentage fees mentioned for processing loans are quoted exclusive of the mandated government tax.

### 4. Other Related Charges

It is important to note that some lenders explicitly waive specific fees to attract customers:

*   **Piramal Finance** offers **Nill Foreclosure Charges** and **Nill Part-payment Charges**.
*   **Bandhan Bank** offers **No foreclosure charges** on loan amounts of ₹10 Lakhs and above.

Bajaj Finserv notes that processing fees and charges will be applicable as per the Full Underwriting program, but the specific amounts are not detailed in the provided excerpts.

The processing fee acts as the cost of setting up the loan, analogous to paying a single administrative fee (plus tax) to enroll in a university course, covering the initial paperwork, verification, and administrative overhead, distinct from the tuition (interest) and late payment penalties (foreclosure charges).





The geographic eligibility criteria are highly restrictive for most lenders, often limiting sourcing to major city hubs (Metro/Prime) and surrounding areas. While some lenders do define policies for Rural areas, many non-preferred locations or specific pincodes are explicitly excluded, especially for high-risk loan products.

### Geographic Restrictions Estimate

  ]
}
```

***

## Detailed Breakdown of Geographic Restrictions

### 1. States NOT Covered

The sources do not provide a list of entire states that are excluded (like the Northeast or J&K). However, restrictions are often applied by defining eligible locations or by excluding certain entities within a state:

*   **Haryana State:** Specific programs, such as the 100% BT Program, Govt Employee Program - 100% BT, MTS 100% BT, Normal BT, and CC BT, are **not allowed to source in Growth locations of Haryana state** & G4 market.
*   **West Bengal:** **Government School Teachers** are **not allowed in all locations of West Bengal**.
*   **Location Proximity:** For Bajaj Finserv Employee Loans in non-SALPL locations, the processing branch must be in the **same state & within $\le 100$ KMs** of the nearest SALPL branch, implying a reliance on regional presence.

### 2. Pincode and City Exclusions (Negative Areas)

Lenders maintain lists of Negative Areas or specific locations where sourcing is either banned outright or allowed only under severe restrictions.

*   **BFL Negative Area/OGL (Negative Geographical Limits):** BFL states that **Negative Area/ OGL is not allowed to process**.
    *   **Conditional Sourcing in Negative Areas:** Sourcing *is* allowed in a Negative area if the customer meets stringent criteria: **CIBIL Score $\ge 720$ AND Bureau Thick customer**.
*   **Specific Excluded Cities/Towns (BFL 100% BT Program):** Bajaj Finserv explicitly prohibits the 100% BT Program in **14 locations**: Bhavnagar, Rohtak, Faizabad, Malda, Eluru, Vellore, Hazaribagh, Sambalpur, Gorakhpur Up, Bulandshahr, Jagdalpur, Kurnool, Dindigul, and Kaithal.
*   **City Exclusion for Programs:** **Chandigarh** is explicitly **not allowed to process** in the Paperless BT and NIP programs.
*   **Location-Specific Segment Restrictions:** In Delhi & its Annex locations, sourcing from **Govt Hospitals will be restricted**.

### 3. Rural Area Restrictions and Coverage

Lender policies indicate three approaches to lower-tier locations: defining specific low-income policies for them, or severely restricting geographic reach to urban cores.

*   **Explicit Rural/Semi-Urban Policies:**
    *   **Axis Finance** explicitly defines minimum income norms for **Semi-Urban** and **Rural** areas, alongside Metro and Urban, confirming coverage in these areas with specific requirements (e.g., minimum NTH for CAT A in Rural is ₹20k).
    *   **L&T Finance** uses the classification **Tier 3+** with a minimum salary requirement of ₹20k (for age $<35$).
*   **Geographic Proximity Limitations:** Many policies impose strict distance caps from existing branch locations, which implicitly excludes deep rural areas:
    *   **Poonawalla Fincorp** restricts the Geo Limit to **80 kms from Branches**, calculated from Municipal offices.
    *   **Muthoot Finance** applies a Geo Limit of **60Km From (600026)** (a Chennai Pincode).
    *   **MAS Financial Services** limits sourcing to **30 km** from the Little Mount Metro area.
*   **BFL Residence Requirement:** BFL generally requires the residence to be **within the approved city limits**. For lower market categories (Market Category $<120$), residence must be within **27.5 km** from the BFL Branch, and for higher categories (Market Category $>120$), residence must be within **30 km**.

These proximity rules essentially create tight metropolitan boundaries, ensuring coverage in Urban and Semi-Urban areas but heavily limiting true rural coverage, unless the rural area falls within the defined kilometer radius of a major branch.




The available sources confirm that Balance Transfer (BT) and Top-up loans are widely offered as core products or special programs, and Co-applicants are generally allowed under specific conditions to enhance eligibility. However, the sources do not specify any schemes offering preferential terms or lower rates specifically for female applicants.

### Estimated Output

## Detailed Breakdown of Special Programs and Offers

### 1. Balance Transfer (BT) Allowed

Balance Transfer (BT) facilities are commonly offered by major lenders and specialty finance companies, covering transfers from personal loans, credit cards, and other secured products, often utilizing specialized, paperless processes.

*   **Bajaj Finserv (BFL):** BFL operates multiple dedicated BT programs, including **Paperless Balance Transfer**, **Normal BT**, and **CC BT (Credit Card BT)**. BFL allows the transfer of Personal Loans (PL), but the BT loan must have a minimum seasoning of 6 MOB, or **12 MOB** for loans from certain banks like Standard Chartered Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, and HSBC Bank. The **CC BT program** is highly specialized, allowing BT for a maximum of 2 credit cards, and requires specific checks for overutilized cards or late/overdue fees.
*   **Aditya Birla Capital Ltd (ABCL):** ABCL explicitly offers **BT** and a dedicated **Paperless BT program**. They allow up to **6 BT** transactions, which can be a combination of credit card and personal loan tracks. They also offer **OD 2 OD BT** (Overdraft to Overdraft Balance Transfer).
*   **TATA Capital:** TATA Capital allows a maximum of **6 BTs** (including Credit Card BT). They offer BT programs in both **Hybrid Term Loan** (including OD BT, PL BT, CC BT, and Jumbo Loan BT) and **Term Loan** products.
*   **L&T Finance:** Allows **Personal Loan BT** and **OD BT** provided the loan has a minimum of **6 EMIs paid** and a minimum cashout of ₹1 Lac.
*   **Poonawalla Fincorp:** Offers BT for **OD/CC/App/PL Loan on CC**. They also handle **App based PL** where a recent app loan can be taken as BT.
*   **Kotak Mahindra Bank:** Balance Transfer is allowed. BT sourcing is allowed post **6 MOB** for selective customers.
*   **Piramal Finance & SHRIRAM Finance:** Piramal allows **App Loans BT** from specific providers (InCred, Navi, Moneyview & Kredit Bee). SHRIRAM allows up to **5 Credit card and 5 PL BT**.

### 2. Top-up Loans Offered

Top-up facilities, which allow customers to increase their existing loan amount or avail a new loan soon after acquisition, are common, particularly for existing customers (ETB).

*   **Bajaj Finserv (BFL):** BFL offers several avenues for top-up funding:
    *   **Pre-approved TOPUP program**.
    *   **Top-up/Parallel full UW** is allowed.
    *   Any **top-up to existing SALPL or BFL/BFSD unsecured customer is allowed after 4 MOB** (Months on Book) under full underwriting norms. This requires the closure of all existing live SALPL loans if it is a FUW Top-up. Note that in specific programs like Paperless BT, Employee loan, and MTS, a minimum of **6 MOB** is required for existing BFL unsecured loans.
*   **TATA Capital:** Customers are eligible for a **top-up after 90 days**, and DSAs can resubmit the file for a top-up at that time.
*   **Poonawalla Fincorp:** Top-up is allowed after a minimum of **6 MOB** is completed, provided the existing loan is checkable and wherever the customer is eligible for the loan.

### 3. Co-applicant/Co-borrower Allowed

Co-applicant features are utilized primarily to meet minimum eligibility requirements (e.g., salary, FOIR) or when the primary applicant is young.

*   **Bajaj Finserv (BFL):** BFL provides specific **Co-applicant norms**:
    *   Co-applicants can only be the **spouse or parents**.
    *   The applicant and financial Co-Applicant must be residing at the **same residence**.
    *   Minimum combined Net Salary is required, varying by location (e.g., ₹60,000 p.m. for Prime/G1 in Kolkata/Ahmedabad/Chandigarh, and ₹70,000 p.m. for others).
    *   The co-applicant's individual salary must meet a minimum threshold (e.g., not below ₹25k for Prime/G1 locations).
*   **Kotak Mahindra Bank:** They explicitly process **Applicant and Co-Applicant cases by adding both the Salary (Clubbed Income)**.
*   **Poonawalla Fincorp:** **Clubbing of Co-Applicant salary is allowed**, provided the Co-applicant meets all the norms applicable to the primary applicant.
*   **MAS Financial Services:** They can **club the income** of immediate family members such as **husband and wife, father son, mother son**.
*   **Muthoot Finance:** **Co-Applicant** is explicitly required for applicants aged **21–23**.

### 4. Women-Specific Schemes or Lower Rates

The provided policy documents, eligibility grids, and case studies do not contain any information referencing special loan schemes, discounted interest rates, or relaxed eligibility criteria exclusively designated for women. All applicants, regardless of gender (as seen in the rejection cases of R. L. Nisha, K. SeethaLakshmi, Shakina M, K. Suganya, R. Yashika, and C. Anitha), appear to be assessed against the same parameters for CIBIL, salary, tenure, and FOIR.

***
**Analogy for Special Programs:**
If a personal loan is a standard commuter train ticket, the special programs act as flexible options and upgrades:
*   **Balance Transfer (BT)** is like consolidating all your separate train tickets (credit card, old loans) into one single, cheaper monthly pass.
*   **Top-up Loan** is like an existing commuter being allowed to borrow extra money for a quick side trip, provided they have a good payment record on their original pass (loan).
*   **Co-applicant** is like pooling two people's funds to buy a premium pass, ensuring that even if one person's salary is low, the combined eligibility ensures access to the desired service.




The eligibility of an applicant is highly dependent on their existing debt profile, encompassing the total number of loans, the status of repayments, and their relationship with the current lender.

Here is the structured summary of the existing loan and EMI tolerance rules:

```json
"existing_loan_rules": {
  "max_active_loans": 3,
  "same_lender_running_loan": false,
  "max_dpd_allowed": 0
}
```

***

## Detailed Analysis of Existing Loan/EMI Tolerance

### 1. Maximum Number of Existing Loans Allowed

Lender policies typically enforce strict limits on the number of unsecured loans, as excessive active accounts signal high leverage and financial risk, even if the borrower's debt-to-income ratio (FOIR) might seem manageable initially.

*   **Standard Unsecured Limit (Bajaj Finserv - BFL):** BFL's DOE 2 Risk Policy mandates that the count of live unsecured loans should be **less than 3** (loans of $\le$ ₹20,000 are not counted towards this limit). At the customer level, BFL allows a maximum of **3 LIVE Unsecured Loans** (including BFSD loans).
*   **Absolute Total Limit (BFL):** At the customer level, BFL allows a maximum of **7 LIVE Loans** in total, excluding secured products like mortgages, credit cards, Gold Loans (GL), and value-added services (VAS).
*   **High-Risk Program Limits (MTS):** The Marginal Segment Tracking (MTS) program does not allow **$>=3$ Personal Loans (PLs)**, including BFL's own loans (excluding PLs sanctioned for less than ₹20,000).
*   **BT Program Limits:** For the Paperless Balance Transfer (BT) program, applicants with **$>=3$ live unsecured loans** in the CIBIL report are generally not allowed to source.
*   **Tolerance Claim (TATA Capital):** TATA Capital states that they **do not factor in the number of active loans** a customer may have (whether two, three, or more) when evaluating the application.
*   **Observed Rejections:** Rejection case files confirm that carrying multiple loans is a major risk flag: Saravanakumar was rejected due to **five active loans**, and Suganya was rejected due to **four active loans**.

**Conclusion:** While some lenders claim indifference, the maximum safe limit for most risk-averse programs is **3 active unsecured loans**.

### 2. Running Loan with Same Lender (BFL/Same Lender)

The ability to obtain a new loan while an existing loan with the same lender is running depends heavily on whether the new application is classified as "Top-up" or "Parallel/Fresh."

*   **Parallel Funding is Restricted (BFL):** Bajaj Finserv explicitly states that an **Existing BFL SALPL loan must be processed in BTTP only. Parallel funding is not allowed**.
*   **Top-up Timing:** Any top-up funding for an existing SALPL or BFL/BFSD unsecured customer is typically allowed only **after 4 Months on Book (MOB)** under full underwriting norms. For specific programs (Paperless BT, Employee Loan, MTS), a minimum of **6 MOB** is required.
*   **Mandatory Closure for Fresh UW Top-up:** If a Full Underwriting (FUW) Top-up is being processed, **all existing live SALPL loans are required to be closed** (a sanction condition must be marked at the underwriting stage).
*   **Max Limit of BFL Loans:** A customer cannot have **more than 2 SALPL live loans** running simultaneously with BFL.

**Conclusion:** Obtaining a *fresh* or *parallel* loan without closing the existing one is generally **not allowed** by major lenders like BFL. A second loan is usually facilitated through a top-up program after a seasoning period, and often requires consolidating or closing the previous loan if undergoing full underwriting.

### 3. DPD (Days Past Due) Tolerance

Lenders maintain a near-zero tolerance for recent delinquency, classifying any recent DPD as an immediate high-risk factor, often leading to automatic rejection.

*   **Zero Tolerance (Recent):** Most programs mandate **No DPD (less than 30 DPD) in the last 6 months**.
*   **30+ DPD Hard Cut:**
    *   **BFL:** **No 30+ DPD allowed in the last 12 months** (except for credit card balances). BT programs require **No DPD in BT loan in last 12 months** and **No 30+ DPD ever** in the BT bank loan.
    *   **InCred:** Any tradeline with **DPD 30+ in the last 3 months** or DPD 60+ in the last 12 months will lead to a **straightforward rejection**.
    *   **Poonawalla Fincorp:** **More than 30 DPD is not allowed in any loan** (except Gold Loan and Credit Card).
*   **On-Us Delinquency:** For a lender's own loans (On-Us), the **Current Bucket should be 0 (No DPD)**.
*   **Minor Bounces:** While DPD is restricted, some policies, like MAS Financial Services, allow for the funding of cases where the latest bouncing occurred but was **cleared within 7 days with a genuine reason**. However, BFL states that no **EMI bounce in the last 3 months** is allowed, though bounces for technical reasons are acceptable.
*   **Rejection Evidence:** R. Kavin Kumar was rejected due to **late payment behavior (DPD)**, specifically a recent late payment on a housing loan. P. Rajkamal was rejected due to a payment delay (**"last 1 month DPD"**).

**Conclusion:** The maximum effective DPD allowed for successful approval in standard and preferred segments is **0 DPD in the last 3 to 6 months**, with absolute rejection for any **30+ DPD event in the last 12 months**. Minor, technical payment failures cleared quickly may be mitigated, but any sustained delinquency (30+ DPD) is disqualifying.




This detailed response outlines the documentation mandates for salaried personal loan applicants, focusing on the minimum required duration for income and banking proofs, and the necessity of tax forms for various segments, especially New-to-Credit (NTC) customers.

### Documentation Requirements Summary

```json
"documentation": {
  "salary_slips_months": 3,
  "bank_statements_months": 6,
  "form_16_required": false,
  "itr_for_ntc_salaried": false
}
```

***

## Detailed Breakdown of Documentation Requirements

### 1. Salary Slips (Payslips)

The requirement for salary slips varies significantly depending on the customer's risk segment and whether the lender employs an automated verification process (No Payslip Program or NIP).

| Requirement | Months | Supporting Details & Nuances | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Standard/High Risk** | **3 months** | Mandatorily required for Bajaj Finserv (BFL) applicants in **Amber/Red Segment**. Also required for the BFL Bureau No-Hit (NTC) Program and in the Unlisted LLP Program. Bandhan Bank requires the **latest 3 months’ salary slip**. Required for all segments in the BFL SAL GOV program. | |
| **Minimum Requirement**| **1 month** | Required for BFL applicants in the lowest risk **Super Green & Green Segment** and mandated for the Marginal Segment Tracking (MTS) Program. Werize requires **any one recent month salary slip**. | |
| **Waiver (No Payslip)** | **0 months** | Salary slips are **not required** in BFL's NIP Program (No Payslip Program) and if banking is provided through Account Aggregator (AA)/OCR/Perfios, provided other parameters are met. Aditya Birla Capital Ltd (ABCL) also states **no salary slips required** based on PF & OMC confirmation. IDFC First Bank does not require a payslip up to ₹15 lakhs if salary validation is successful. | |
| **Conditional Requirement**| **3 months** | Payslips for the last 3 months are mandatory in the BFL ABB Program if **addbacks** (like VPF, GPF, or Quarterly Incentive) are claimed to boost eligibility. | |

### 2. Bank Statements

Bank statement requirements are stricter and longer than payslips, as they are crucial for verifying salary credits, managing cash flow, and checking for recent delinquency and average bank balance (ABB).

| Requirement | Months | Supporting Details & Nuances | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Standard / Full UW** | **6 months** | Mandatorily required for BFL's Full Underwriting (FUW) Program, ABB Program, DOE 2, DOE 3, and SALPL ETB DOE Program. Required for Self-Employed Non-Professionals at InCred. Required if the customer is employed in an unlisted company under the DOE1 program. | |
| **Minimum Requirement**| **3 months** | Required for BFL's Bureau No-Hit (NTC) Program and SAL GOV Program. Bandhan Bank requires **3 months’ Salary account statement**. The salary certificate for government employees must be supported by **last 3 months salary credits in bank**. Muthoot Finance requires recent **3 month transaction** availability in the bank statement for address proof. | |
| **Extended/Conditional**| **1 Year** | Werize requires **1 Year Banking** history with a minimum of 9 months salary credit. If current employment is less than 1 month, BFL requires **6 months banking of the previous employer** to be documented and verified. | |

### 3. Form 16 Requirement

Form 16 is not a mandatory primary document for all salaried loan applications, especially when digital verification (Perfios/AA) and recent payslips are available. However, it is widely accepted and used as a secondary or confirmatory document.

*   **Piramal Finance** explicitly states they **can process based on Form-16 and IT Returns**.
*   **BFL (Government Segment):** Form 16 is one of the accepted proofs used by Credit to confirm **Current work experience** for Government employees, alongside payslip where Date of Joining (DOJ) is mentioned, or appointment/confirmation letters.
*   **BFL (NTC/Waiver):** **Form 26AS** (linked to ITR/Form 16) is a key document that can be used to meet Geo tagging waiver norms via VKYC and is mandatory when processing cases with salary **addbacks**.
*   **Chola:** Accepts **CD/Form 16** (up to 3 years old) for historical employment verification, particularly for category D applicants.

### 4. ITR Requirement for NTC Customers

For salaried NTC (CIBIL 0/-1) customers, the primary documentation focus is on recent, verifiable income (payslips and bank credits). **ITR is generally not required for salaried NTC profiles**, but it is mandatory for self-employed applicants.

*   **Salaried NTC (BFL Bureau No-Hit):** The mandatory documents are **3 months’ payslip** and **3 months banking** verified digitally (Perfios/AA/OCR). Identity and employment checks (EPAN, mobile verification, email confirmation) are critical. ITR is *not* listed as mandatory.
*   **Salaried NTC (ABCL/Finnable):** These lenders allow NTC profiles but rely on digital confirmation and salary slips/banking statements.
*   **Conditional ITR Use for Salaried:** ITR-related documents (Form 26AS) are mandatory at BFL if the applicant utilizes salary **addbacks**.
*   **Mandatory ITR for Self-Employed:** For **Non-Salaried/Self-Employed** applicants, ITR is crucial. InCred requires **Last 2 years ITR** (acknowledgement and computation mandatory) as proof of business vintage (alternative to GST proof). Bandhan Bank requires **Latest 1 year ITR with computation** for non-salaried applicants.





### Category 14: Disbursement Timeline

Disbursement timelines are highly differentiated across lenders, with standard processing typically taking up to 48 hours for fully documented cases. However, for digital processes and pre-approved or low-risk applications, **same-day or 24-hour** fast-track disbursement is explicitly offered.

### Estimated Output

```json
"disbursement": {
  "standard_days": 2,
  "fast_track_available": true,
  "fast_track_days": 1,
  "instant_disbursal_offers": true
}
```

***

## Detailed Analysis of Disbursement Timelines

### 1. Fast-Track and Standard Disbursement Timelines

Several major lenders emphasize rapid disbursement, often citing timelines of 24 to 48 hours for complete applications, while some prioritize same-day funding for approved files.

*   **Same-Day Disbursement:** Aditya Birla Capital Ltd (ABCL) explicitly advertises that approved cases will disburse **on the same day**. This capability is supported by their digital process, from login to disbursement.
*   **48-Hour Disbursement:** L&T Finance states that the complete digital and paperless process allows cases to be disbursed **within 48 hours**, subject to all documents being correctly submitted.
*   **24-Hour Disbursement:** Finnable offers a disbursement timeline of **4 to 24 hours**.
*   **Standard Approval Validity:** While disbursement can be fast, BFL notes that the loan approval validity is **up to 1 month post approval**.

### 2. Pre-Approved Offers and Instant Disbursal

The sources frequently mention pre-approved offers, which generally imply the fastest possible disbursement, though BFL applies specific constraints on these programs.

*   **Pre-approved TOPUP Program:** BFL offers a Pre-approved TOPUP program. Although instant disbursal is often implied for such offers, the sources do not explicitly state "instant disbursal" in terms of zero delay, but rather categorize these among the programs where geo-tagging and certain checks are waived, suggesting highly streamlined processing.
*   **Conditional Fast-Track Approvals:** Kotak Mahindra Bank offers a **Conditional 4 hours approval TAT** (Turnaround Time) for all cases. While this is an approval timeline, it precedes and enables fast disbursement.

### 3. Disbursement Mechanisms and Control Checks

The disbursement process often involves critical checks to ensure the funds reach the correct account and to manage risk, particularly in balance transfer (BT) cases.

*   **Salary Account Mandate:** For BFL's Bureau No-Hit Program, disbursement and repayment must be **from the Salary bank account only**, with no deviation allowed.
*   **Secondary Bank Disbursal:** If a customer needs disbursement in a **secondary bank account** (non-salary bank account), **RCM approval is mandatory**. The secondary account must also be validated through the bank verification policy.
*   **Balance Transfer (BT) Disbursement:** In BT cases (Normal BT/Paperless BT), operations teams may hand over a customer-favoring cheque to the business team based on:
    *   Loan Closure proof (NOC/SOA with status as Closed).
    *   Foreclosure letter with the bank’s seal and signature.
    *   Deposition Slip (mandatory for the sales team to mention the cheque number and ensure the bank stamp is marked).
*   **Disbursement Checks:** Geo tagging, if required, must be fulfilled **before disbursement of the file**.

**In summary, lenders have moved aggressively toward digital processing, enabling rapid, often same-day, disbursement for verified applications, while standard timelines remain below 48 hours, subject to complete documentation and verification checks.**




The determination of maximum loan eligibility is critically linked to the **Multiplier** factor. This multiplier is not static but varies dramatically based on a complex interplay between the applicant's **CIBIL Score/Risk Segment**, their **Salary Band**, and the **Loan Product** they are applying for.

### Multiplier Variation Summary

```json
"multiplier_by_segment": {
  "standard_mid_risk": 20,
  "prime_listed_high_salary": 27,
  "super_prime_highest_income": 32
}
```

***

## Detailed Analysis of Multiplier Variations

The final eligibility calculation for many lenders, such as Bajaj Finserv (BFL), is determined by taking the **Minimum of FOIR, Multiplier, and Policy Capping**. Therefore, achieving a high multiplier is essential for maximizing the loan amount.

### 1. Variation by CIBIL Score Bracket and Risk Segment

The multiplier is inextricably linked to the customer's risk segment, which is derived from a combination of their CIBIL score and internal scorecards (like the PL Score). Higher perceived quality and better credit history directly translate to a higher multiplier.

| Segment / Score | Example Multiplier Range (X times Net Income) | Lender | Supporting Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Super Prime (AA/Super Green)** | **24x to 32x** | Kotak, BFL, TATA | Kotak’s AA segment with income >₹75k applies a **32x** multiplier. BFL Super Green with specific criteria can reach **24x**. Chola’s CAT A/Govt Employees can reach **30x**. |
| **Mid-Risk (Green/CAT B)** | **16x to 22x** | BFL, TATA | BFL Prime/Green segment ranges from 14x to 20x based on salary. TATA Capital’s CAT B segment with salary $>75k$ gets **25x**. |
| **High Risk/Marginal (Amber/Red/CAT D/MTS)** | **10x to 14x** | BFL, L&T | BFL’s Red segment receives a flat **10x** across all Prime and Growth salary bands. BFL’s Marginal Segment Tracking (MTS) program applies a flat **10x** multiplier. L&T CAT D receives 14x (OTHERS). |
| **NTC / High Risk Specialized** | **Max 14x** | BFL | The BFL Bureau No-Hit (CIBIL 0/-1) Program caps the maximum multiplier at **14x**. |

### 2. Variation by Income Slab (Net Take Home Salary)

For a given risk segment, the multiplier often increases as the applicant's salary rises, rewarding higher income stability and repayment capacity.

*   **BFL Prime Market:** For the Green Segment, the multiplier jumps from **14x** (for salary $<50k$) to **20x** (for salary $\ge 75k$).
*   **TATA Capital:** For the TGE/Super CAT A segment, the multiplier scales: **21x** ($<50k$), **24x** ($50k$ to $75k$), and **27x** ($>75k$).
*   **Chola (CAT C Segment):** For 49–60 months tenure, the multiplier increases stepwise: **15x** ($<30k$), **20x** ($30k$ to $<50k$), and **25x** ($>75k$).
*   **BFL Salary Kicker:** BFL allows an additional **10% incremental kicker** on the existing multiplier for existing customers in Super Green and Green segments with salary $\ge 50K$.

### 3. Variation by Customer Segment (Company and Policy Type)

The multiplier is heavily influenced by the applicant's employer category and the specific program utilized.

*   **Unlisted Companies:** Customers working for unlisted companies face significant restrictions. BFL applies a flat multiplier of **10x** across *all risk segments* for the Unlisted company category. Similarly, the DOE1 – Unlisted program restricts the multiplier to a maximum of **10x** on Net Take Home (NTH) Salary.
*   **Special Programs (Premium Access):** The highest multipliers are reserved for applicants meeting stringent criteria, such as those with existing Home Loans (HL) or excellent bureau conduct. BFL allows a maximum multiplier of **24x** specifically for Super Green segment customers with salary $\ge 75K$ who also have an **Ever HL in bureau** and fewer than two live unsecured loans.
*   **Calculation Method:** It is important to note that most lenders apply the multiplier directly to the Net Take Home (NTH) salary. Kotak Mahindra Bank, however, explicitly states their logic uses the residual income: **(NTH - Obligation) \* Multiplier**.

### Multipliers vs. FOIR

In contrast to lenders using the multiplier method, some institutions rely solely on the FOIR (Fixed Obligation to Income Ratio) calculation to determine eligibility, thus simplifying the loan cap assessment:

*   **Piramal Finance** explicitly states **No Multiplier Calculation** is used, and eligibility is determined by the FOIR, which is allowed up to 75%.
*   **MAS Financial Services** also relies **Only FOIR basis approval**.

The complexity of the multiplier grids (varying across dozens of combinations of salary, segment, and tenure, as seen in the BFL and Chola policies) ensures that the loan amount is precisely calibrated to the proven stability and risk profile of the applicant. This process is analogous to calculating the maximum safe speed limit for a vehicle, where the limit is determined by combining the capability of the engine (income slab), the quality of the tires and chassis (CIBIL score/segment), and the specific conditions of the road (loan program/tenure).
